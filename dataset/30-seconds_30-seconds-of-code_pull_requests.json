The current code fails to restore nested properties and doesnot cater for scenairos like\r\n```js\r\nunflattenObject({ 'a.b': 1, 'a.c': 2, d: 3 })\r\nunflattenObject({ 'a.b': 'foo', d: 3 })\r\n```\r\nwhere either the same key is being refered more than once or the values are non numbers. More detials can be seen in [this](https://runkit.com/tbasse/5f2a9929c9b5c9001a4d3a6e) runkit shared in the issue as well.\r\n\r\nAn additional scenario which the code failed to handle was when the flat path reffered to particular indices in the arrays values against a key. For example.\r\n```js\r\nunflattenObject({ 'a.b.0': 5, d: 3 })\r\n```\r\nshould return something like `{a:{b:[5]}, d: 3}`. However, the code fails to compile.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nI fixed the snippet to handle these scenarios along with some improvements. The updated code which passes all these tests can be seen in [this](https://runkit.com/taimoor0217/unflattenobject) runkit.\r\n\r\n**Modifications / Improvements**\r\n\r\nThe previous code uses `JSON.parse()` to parse the manually built string into JSON and then merges it with the accumulator using `Object.assign()`. This happened for ever iteration of `Array.prototype.reduce()`. My code takes a slightly different approach of making the reference to the values as the next accumulator. This ways, I can directly mutate and nested objects without having to merge on each iteration. This arguably improves the performance fo the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Unfortunately current implementation of it fails for a particular case:\r\n(Where one key is prefix of another and it has object value, in this case `b` & `b.c`)\r\n```\r\nlet obj = {\r\n  'a': 1,\r\n  'b': { 'e': 4 },\r\n  'b.c': 5\r\n};\r\n\r\nhasKey(obj, 'b.c');\r\n// should return \"true\" but returns \"false\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above scenario can not be handled with current method signature of accepting second argument as string. Using function signature where it accepts Array of keys, we can address above scenario along with other simpler cases.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies overall implementation of function without using any recursion or string manipulations. With Array as key list, we can use `Array.prototype.every()` to simplify and early return on failure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- If your PR resolves an issue, please state \"Resolves #(issue number)\" to help maintainers process it faster -->\r\nThis PR updates [hasKey](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code#haskey) snippet to handle this failing cases along with existing ones and simplifies overall implementation of the function.\r\n<!-- If you think your PR will cause breaking changes, require changes in the documentation etc, please be so kind as to explain what, where and how -->\r\nThis changes signature of [hasKey](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code#haskey) snippet to accept list of strings instead of just a string, which can be called as a breaking change.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n- [x] Snippets, Tests & Tags (new snippets, updated snippets, re-tagging of snippets, added/updated tests)\r\n- [ ] Tools, Scripts & Automation (anything related to files in the scripts folder, Gatsby, website, Travis CI or Netlify)\r\n- [ ] General, Typos, Misc. & Meta (everything related to content, typos, general stuff and meta files in the repository - e.g. the issue template)\r\n- [ ] Other (please specifiy in the description above)\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\n- [x] I have read the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.\r\n",

By default, Jest tests complete once they reach the end of their execution. If there are assertions on asynchronous code, but we don't make Jest aware of it, those tests will simply pass.\r\n\r\nThere are specific ways to make Jest wait for expectations:\r\n\r\nFor callback-based code, we can introduce the `done` argument on each test. This is a callback function provided by Jest. Each test will wait for this callback to be executed after the desired assertions are done. If the `done` callback is not invoked, the test will timeout.\r\n\r\nFor promise-based code, we can simply return the promise from the test and use run the expectations on the `then`. Or we can use the `resolves` / `rejects` helpers.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can use also async / await, by making the test closure async, and using await get the values to do the expectations.\r\n\r\nMore details about this on the [official docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/asynchronous).\r\n \r\n<!-- Write a detailed description of your changes/additions here -->\r\n<!-- If your PR resolves an issue, please state \"Resolves #(issue number)\" to help maintainers process it faster -->\r\n<!-- If you think your PR will cause breaking changes, require changes in the documentation etc, please be so kind as to explain what, where and how -->\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n- [x] Snippets, Tests & Tags (new snippets, updated snippets, re-tagging of snippets, added/updated tests)\r\n- [ ] Scripts & Website & Meta (anything related to files in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/tree/master/scripts), how the repository's automated procedures work and the website)\r\n- [ ] Glossary & Secondary Features (anything related to the glossary, such as new or updated terms or other secondary features)\r\n- [ ] General, Typos, Misc. & Meta (everything else, typos, general stuff and meta files in the repository - e.g. the issue template)\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\n- [x] I have read the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.\r\n",

It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner). See how it looks on this [repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).\r\n\r\nYou can also add a postinstall script to let people know after npm|yarn install that you are welcoming donations (optional). [More info](https://github.com/OpenCollective/opencollective-cli)\r\nYou can also add a \"Donate\" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets.

I know that negative zero doesn't exist in real Math but this is just how JavaScript engine threats it. Whenever JavaScript engine works with dividing negatives, it treats them as positives and adds `-` afterward.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\nNot much as you've guessed it but this function can be used when writing complex animations, a `-0` on just finished animation can provide information on whether the animation was coming from the right or the left side etc. \r\n\r\n#### Note about tests\r\nI wrote the tests, they don't pass due to the way they work. In order to make them work the `_30s` needs `isNegativeZero` module in it.

Reasonable performance increase (7.8s -> 5.1s).\r\n- Updated `module.js` to output a full (snippets + archive) `_30s.js` file in `test`. Negligible performance impact.\r\n- Made `module.js` skip bundles when running on non-CRON/API builds. Performance for the test package seems to be ~52ms on my machine, which should be pretty good for running tests on commits.\r\n- Updated `tdd.js` to follow the structure discussed above, updated all `.test.js` files, fixed a few failing tests, cleaned up orphaned tests etc. Overall performance is about the same, maybe we managed to earn ourselves a second or two.\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\n- [ ] Snippets, Tests & Tags (new snippets, updated snippets, re-tagging of snippets, added/updated tests)\r\n- [x] Scripts & Website & Meta (anything related to files in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/tree/master/scripts), how the repository's automated procedures work and the website)\r\n- [ ] Glossary & Secondary Features (anything related to the glossary, such as new or updated terms or other secondary features)\r\n- [ ] General, Typos, Misc. & Meta (everything else, typos, general stuff and meta files in the repository - e.g. the issue template)\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\n- [x] I have read the guidelines in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.\r\n- [x] My PR doesn't include any `testlog` changes. \r\n",

Please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure this gets updated as well.\n\nThis pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.\n\n**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository\u2019s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83c\udff7 How to check the status of this repository</summary>\n\nGreenkeeper adds a badge to your README which indicates the status of this repository.\n\nThis is what your badge looks like right now :point_right:  ![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code.svg)\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\ude48 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>\n\nYou may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency\u2019s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).\n\nTo make sure Greenkeeper doesn\u2019t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don\u2019t want to update.\n\n```js\n// package.json\n{\n  \u2026\n  \"greenkeeper\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\n      \"package-names\",\n      \"you-want-me-to-ignore\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb How to update this pull request</summary>\n\n```bash\n  # Change into your repository\u2019s directory\n  git fetch\n  git checkout greenkeeper/initial\n  npm install-test\n  # Adapt your code until everything works again\n  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'\n  git push origin greenkeeper/initial\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\u2728 How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>\n\nAfter you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.\n\n```diff\n-  \"underscore\": \"^1.6.0\"\n+  \"underscore\": \"^1.7.0\"\n```\n\nThe above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).\nWhen the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken \u2013 everything is fine.\n\nHowever, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.\n\nThis way, you\u2019ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\n\n```diff\n-  \"lodash\": \"^3.0.0\"\n+  \"lodash\": \"^4.0.0\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.\nFor version updates like these \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cout of range\u201d updates \u2013 you\u2019ll receive a pull request.\n\nThis means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** \u2013 Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.\n\nThese pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:\n\nTo get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\nThere is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html). If those don\u2019t help, you can always [ask the humans behind Greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).\n</details>\n\n\n---\n\nGood luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:\n\nYour [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io) bot :palm_tree:\n",

        "body": "## Description\r\nThis one was missing from `type` category. It is a bit trickier compared to other snippets, so let me explain:\r\n\r\nWe use NaN to define a number that isn't really a number `\"foo\" / 2 = NaN`. `typeof(NaN) -> \"number\"`.\r\n\r\n**NaN compared to anything is false**, even to itself. There is native `isNaN` function but it isn't stable, here are the examples with explanations:\r\n\r\n_native_ isNaN(NaN) _returns_ `true` (this one is okay)\r\n_native_ isNaN(1) _returns_ `false` (this is okay too)\r\n_native_ isNaN(\"1\") _returns_ `false` (this is okay too)\r\n_native_ isNaN(\"foo\") _returns_ `true` (this is **not okay** obviously, it is because of JavaScript coercion) - Number(\"foo\") returns NaN. Therefore isNaN(\"foo\") turns into isNaN(NaN)\r\n\r\nThe solution to the problem:\r\nIn JavaScript the `NaN` is the only value that is treated as following `NaN == NaN returns false`. Therefore, we can use strict inequality to compare such value. The following solution is often asked on job interviews. \r\n\r\n\u2705 I've updated tests accordingly. New tests are passing, however, there were 2 tests that fail from before: `pad` and `toCurrency`\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n## What does your PR belong to?\r\n- [ ] Website\r\n- [x] Snippets\r\n- [ ] General / Things regarding the repository (like CI Integration)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (non-breaking improvement of a snippet)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

This lead this function to give the current date during one hour a year and the day after tomorrow for another hour a year.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the function only worked correctly when the user was in the same timezone as UTC. For example in Amsterdam which 1 hour from DST it only worked 23 hours a day. And in Sydney which is 11 hours away from DST, the function only worked correctly for 13 hours each day. During the hours it didn't work correctly it would give the current date instead of tomorrows.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n**Resolves** #564  <!--- Delete if not a issue fix-->\r\n\r\n## What does your PR belong to?\r\n- [ ] Website\r\n- [x] Snippets\r\n- [ ] General / Things regarding the repository (like CI Integration)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (non-breaking improvement of a snippet)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
