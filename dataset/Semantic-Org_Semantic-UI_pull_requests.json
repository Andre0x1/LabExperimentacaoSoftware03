Please feel free to adapt.\r\n\r\nIf this ends up not being merged, or if it does not trigger the automated commits and release, I suppose the other way to fix this would be in the css parser used by webpack?\r\nOtherwise, workarounds can be found on the issues linked in the commit, namely:\r\n- switching to [Fomantic-UI](https://github.com/fomantic/Fomantic-UI): https://github.com/fomantic/Fomantic-UI/pull/2028\r\n- using the [@semantic-ui-react/css-patch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semantic-ui-react/css-patch) package: https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/7073#issuecomment-1136392772\r\n  - or more manually, using [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package)\r\n- importing the css via a `<style>` tag instead of via webpack, since browsers seem to ignore the double semicolon: https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-CSS/issues/75#issuecomment-1018326560\r\n  - ie.:\r\n     ```css\r\n     <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css\" integrity=\"sha512-8bHTC73gkZ7rZ7vpqUQThUDhqcNFyYi2xgDgPDHc+GXVGHXq+xPjynxIopALmOPqzo9JZj0k6OqqewdGO3EsrQ==\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" />\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would close #7073 once the updated css is published.",

Upgrade Gulp from `3.9.1` to `4.0.0`\r\n2. Upgrade `gulp-help` to the version that specifically supports Gulp4 (`1.6.1` to `chmontgomery/gulp-help#gulp4`)\r\n3. Upgrade additional dependencies that fix additional audit issues (`gulp-concat-css`, `gulp-copy`, `gulp-less`, `gulp-watch`, and `github`)\r\n4. Remove `run-sequence` which is now deprecated and natively replaced with [`gulp.series`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/4.0/docs/API.md#gulpseriestasks)\r\n5. Fix `calc()` errors that arose out of interpolated strings with the latest version of `gulp-less`\r\n\r\nWith those tasks complete, `npm install` works and completes as intended with no errors and 0 security vulnerabilities.",

        "body": "Right now, semantic-ui utilizes `normal` and `bold` values for setting font-weight's throughout the codebase. By default, browsers will map the `bold -> 700` and `normal -> 400` (this is somewhat of a simplification). For the most part, this strategy works.\r\n\r\nI have, however, rubbed up against a requirement where I need to remap these values to different numerical weights (500 and 300). The `@font-face` declarations come down from a 3rd party service and I have no means of adjusting how they are defined. Right now, the only way I was able to accomplish this within semantic-ui, was to declare variables/overrides for all occasions where font-weight is set. It was a horribly tedious and the end solution feels very brittle as the code base changes (created nearly 30 files to accomplish this).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for dynamically setting the font weights used throughout semantic UI by defining three new variables, `fontWeightBold`, `fontWeightNormal`, and `fontWeightIcon`.\r\n\r\nI believe this would properly address the concern brought up in #2846\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for testing these changes, I have built the dist files locally and manually previewed `examples/theming.html`. All UI appeared normal, however, I am uncertain if there is a more robust solution for verifying UI updates.",

        "body": "This an enhancement for making the default theme folder configurable. In the following, I describe a use case which motivates this pull request.\r\n\r\nWe use Semantic-UI at VANTAiO for styling our portal solutions. We provide a common Semantic theme which can be adjusted for each customer.\r\n\r\nWe implemented this by creating a copy of the default Semantic theme and naming it \"common\". We adjusted variables in the .variables files and extended the css in the .overrides files. When we need to customize a theme for a customer, we copy this common theme. All adjustments are performed in this theme.\r\n\r\nThis appproach leads to problems. When we want to perform changes in the common theme, we have to manually adjust the customized theme files. Furthermore, there is lots of redundant code. Differences between the common and the customized themes cannot be seen directly.\r\n\r\nA solution can be performed as followed with the current inheritance architecture of Semantic:\r\n- Put individual variable adjustments and css extensions in the custom theme\r\n- Put the common variable definitions and css extensions in the site folder\r\n\r\nIt has a major disadvantage:\r\nYou cannot use the same variable or css statement in the custom and common theme. The common theme in the sites folder overrides the variable or css statement from the custom folder.\r\n\r\nA better approach is presented in this pull request. You can configure the default theme folder in theme.config and put all your common theme code there. For that you copy the default folder and name it e.g. \"common\". Then you can adjust variables in the .variables files and add css statements in the .overrides files. Consequently, all other themes inherit the variables and new css rules. So they can override them. Changes only have to be made in the common theme.\r\n\r\nThis change does not break anything because the \"default\" folder is configured as the defaultThemeFolder variable. I guess this pull request is interesting for all Semantic UI users who build multi-theme solutions.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of this pull request is that changes of a new semantic version do not break the current styling because everything is fixed in the common theme folder. But one has to manually merge the default theme with the common theme. Since this feature is opt-in, there is no problem with it.",

The `require-dot-file` module recursively goes higher up from the `node_modules` directory. If you `console.log` the currentPath and nexDirectory, you clearly see :\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncurrentPath: ../package.json\r\nnextDirectory: /home/skd/webserver/myproject/src/web\r\ncurrentPath: /home/skd/webserver/myproject/src/web/package.json\r\nnextDirectory: /home/skd/webserver/myproject/src\r\ncurrentPath: /home/skd/webserver/myproject/src/package.json\r\nnextDirectory: /home/skd/webserver/myproject\r\ncurrentPath: /home/skd/webserver/myproject/package.json\r\nnextDirectory: /home/skd/webserver\r\ncurrentPath: /home/skd/webserver/package.json\r\nnextDirectory: /home/skd\r\ncurrentPath: /home/skd/package.json\r\nnextDirectory: /home\r\ncurrentPath: /home/package.json\r\nnextDirectory: /\r\ncurrentPath: /package.json\r\nnextDirectory: /\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in the expression installation, if I wish to install to a sub sub folder at `/home/skd/webserver/myproject/src/web/foo/bar`, then it will search for a `semantic.json` from `/home/skd/webserver/myproject/src/web` and higher directories and hence the config is not accesible and hence `gulpConfig` reverts to default configuration.\r\n\r\nOne possible fix is to use, the walk directory parameter of `require-dot-file` `requireDotFile('semantic.json','/home/skd/webserver/myproject/src/web')`  to specify which folder to start the walk from. But this is kinda redundant because we have mention the project location in `semantic.json`. Therefore, the best way is to get rid of `require-dot-file` and use the one invariant for this case. Which is, `semantic.json` is always 3 levels higher than `user.js`\r\n\r\nFixes: #5418 ",

However, this brings the issue of calculating proper height, which must take into account the size of the other modal elements - header and buttons.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with this implementation is that neither actions, header or even content heights are not accessible before the modal is visible and therefore either predefined value must be used or visible resize is necessary after it's shown (I opted for the first one, especially even imprecise values give correct result).\r\nAlternative would be to use flexbox for modal layout.\r\n\r\nNOTE: As long as there is no **scrollable** class within the first level modal elements, no existing code should be affected.",

The legacy backend returns JSON that requires processing. One key in the returned JSON is 'html' from which, say a tab's HTML contents, would be pulled.\n\nThough my question applies to all API calls, running with tabs is a useful case study. A tab is hardwired to seek and get returned from server plain HTML. My objective would be to leverage as much Semantic tab logic as possible but get it to work with this legacy JSON backend.\n\nThis discussion regarding a related topic discusses the use of 'mockResponseAsync' for a related purpose:\nhttps://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/1736\n\nIt seems onResponse is the simpler solution. I was glad to find it. But I did not understand why the response text was being transformed into a hash before being sent to the 'onResponse' callback. The first thing I need to do on the other end is reassemble the _original_ response text so I can process it in proprietary fashion. Maybe there's a reason for this transformation?\n\nMy suggestion retains the default and offers a flag to skip this wasteful transformation so it needn't happen every server hit if it is not necessary.\n\nMaybe I misunderstood 'mockResponseAsync' and that's where I should be working? If not, maybe the default behavior for 'onResponse' transforming the text might be confusing to others as well.\n\nThanks for the awesome work. I look forward to getting deeper. Even without this change, it's cool that hooks are in place so I can wire Semantic into a legacy app.\n",

When the grid is `stackable` and resized to mobile widths in IE/Firefox, this causes the (now horizontal) divider to have a large height. This only occurs if the columns and divider are within a `row` div (possibly due to the `flex` style of the `row` class).\n\nThis PR adds another style that resets back to `height: auto;`.\n\nThe alternative is to add a more specific selector to `divider.less` for the mobile `stackable grid` (on line https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/4ce3085fc4be6770ff270096edc1f09d01bc8016/src/definitions/elements/divider.less#L138). Adding a `.ui.stackable.grid .column + .ui.vertical.divider` selector will cause this style to be applied after the height above, overriding it with `auto`. Happy change the commits in this PR if this is preferable.\n\n**EDIT** Bug also occurs in Firefox, edited description and title to match.\n",

I thought it would be better if there could be a separate component for global utilities.\n\nSome of the styles are already implemented in certain components, for example `.ui.right.floated.image`. However, having the global utilities means that you can put `class=\"ui right floated\"` on any element, not just images, and it will be right floated.\n\nSimilarly with the responsive visibility classes, right now they are only implemented in `ui.grid` but with the utilities you could easily apply responsive visibility to any element.\n\nThe utility rules have lower specificity than the component rules, so the components can easily override the utilities if necessary.\n\nI find this extremely useful when prototyping. I think there could be other useful utilities as well, this is just a start. What do you think?\n",

This is due to the deep copy been set to `true` for `extend`.\n\nSetting it to `false` allows you to compile a semantic build with only the components you want.\n",

        "body": "Hi Jack,\n\nAs you might know, the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) community loves Semantic-UI. We had many different wrapper packages all doing the same thing, so I'm submitting a PR that integrates Meteor packaging directly into your repository.\n\nAll you have to do after accepting this PR is:\n1. create an account at https://meteor.com/ (click SIGN IN, then Create account). After you've done that, please let me know the name of the account, and I'll add you as a maintainer of the `semantic` organization (which has been alredy reserved for you).\n2. head to [Meteor Autopublish](http://autopublish.meteor.com/) sign in with your gitHub account, locate this repository and enable it for autopublish by toggling the checkbox you'll find on the right side of the repository item. You can get an idea about how Meteor Autopublish works by having a quick look at [this page](http://autopublish.meteor.com/howitworks), but basically it creates a [web hook](https://help.github.com/articles/about-webhooks/) to let us know when you push new tags.\n\nPlease note that I've already published the current version of the package on [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/semantic/ui) (Meteor's package directory). When you'll release new versions, autopublish.meteor.com will automatically take delivery for publishing the new version also for Meteor.\n\nThanks & best regards,\nLuca & the [Meteor integrations team](https://github.com/raix/Meteor-community-discussions/issues/14)\n",

If the dimmer is contained in an element with window position \"left: 100px; top: 60px; right: 0; bottom: 0\", then the modal needs to be centered within those dimensions, not the full window dimensions.\n\nA simple fix I found to this was to switch .ui.modal to use position: absolute.  This seems to work when the modal is contained by a dimmer that takes the full page, or when the dimmer is only part of the page.\n\nOne thought I had was that instead of switching .ui.modal to position: absolute, it could be overridden for .ui.dimmer > .ui.modal.\n",

This further break-proofs existing implementations since the user's callbacks are less likely to interfere with the process.\n\nI also made the code a bit more DRY as we were copy/pasting callback functions for animations.\n",

This is NOT dealing with the two line step which has been solved, but rather with the oddly rounded corners on active.\n\nPicture of old code's rounded corner:\n![2014-03-09 12 44 37 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6738227/2444543/ebd62802-ae57-11e3-9cb0-a96521720eb3.png)\ncurrent code: http://jsfiddle.net/FrHze/\n\nThe current arrow definition after the two line step, seems to overlap the rounded corners in a weird way, but now the corners are appropriate whether it will overlap or not. Hopefully this will help a little bit.\n",

I obeyed applying `!important` to latter selector because it's simply discouraged.\n\nWhile images are nice to have for PR's, from now on I will rely only on Example & Test Case fiddles... mainly, due to my laziness.\n\nP.S. This fix extends upon #568. The test case, though, is tuned for 0.12.2, yet, remains forward compatible to #568.\n",

I think doing that could pose some potential problems.\n\nI do realize that other frameworks leave this up to the developer to do during the show/hide events -- and that is certainly one solution. However I feel like it's not really a good UX to NOT do this, so it's kind of silly to require a developer to register an event handler for it. Further, it is awkward for MVVM frameworks, because the events emitted by the modal element will most likely end up dealing with a controller, who should not be messing with the DOM at all. Ergo, it seems a simple thing to make this a configurable behaviour, but it probably makes the most sense to just do it all the time.\n",
