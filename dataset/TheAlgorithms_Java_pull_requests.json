I am writing to propose another optimized solution for checking if two strings are anagrams or not in Java.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n**Approach**\r\n```\r\nboolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {\r\n    if (s.length() != t.length()) {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n    int[] freq = new int[26];\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\r\n      int pos1 = s.charAt(i) - 'a';\r\n      int pos2 = s.charAt(i) - 'a';\r\n      freq[pos1]++;  freq[pos2]--;\r\n    }\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\r\n        if (freq[i] != 0) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- If the lengths of the two strings are different, they cannot be anagrams. Return false.\r\n- Initialize an array of size 26, where each element corresponds to the frequency of a character.\r\n- Iterate through both strings, incrementing the frequency of each character in the first string and decrementing the frequency of each character in the second string.\r\n- Iterate through the frequency array and check if all the elements are zero. If so, the two strings are anagrams of each other. Return true.\r\n- If any element in the frequency array is non-zero, the two strings are not anagrams of each other. Return false.\r\n\r\n**Complexity**\r\n\r\n- The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings.\r\n- The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a fixed-size array. This approach is faster than using a hashmap, as it avoids the overhead of creating and iterating through a hashmap.\r\n\r\n",

After removing some node all links for previous and next node should be reassigned. But current algorithm did not mentioned that next node could be null. For example (on this structure tests had failed in linked build):\r\n```\r\n[ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r\n[ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- [ ] --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] --- --- [ ] --- [ ] --- --- [ ] --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] [ ] --- [ ] --- [ ] --- --- [ ] --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] \r\n H   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10\r\n```\r\nWhen we try to delete node with index 0, it would have null next nodes on layers 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nI had fixed an issue and add test case with removing last node.

Since this is a refactoring change I have merged the refactoring for Hill Cipher, SinglyLinkedList and DoublyLinkedList.\r\n- [ ] Removed duplicate codes by extracting method, renamed variables for better understandability, pulled up variables/methods for better consistency, extracted class to remove feature envy smell and moved method for the same functionality classes. If the pull request is accepted I am looking forward to refactor this entire project since I found multiple smells on SonarQube as well as in DesigniteJava.\r\n\r\n#### References\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any reference to previous pull-request or issue -->\r\n\r\n### **Checklist:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Changed the code so it does not take the input data from the console, rather it takes it from an ArrayList. Changed the output of the answer, instead of getting and system.out.println, I return an ArrayList with the answers. \r\n\r\nAdded one Junit test to test the function and to see that all the code had 100% coverage from it. \r\n\r\n#### References\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Checklist:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

The area of the rectangle with sides a and b is a\u22c5b.\r\n\r\nYour task is to say if it is possible to create exactly n rectangles of equal area or not.\r\n\r\nYou have to answer q independent queries.\r\n\r\nInput\r\nThe first line of the input contains one integer q (1\u2264q\u2264500) \u2014 the number of queries. Then q queries follow.\r\n\r\nThe first line of the query contains one integer n (1\u2264n\u2264100) \u2014 the number of rectangles.\r\n\r\nThe second line of the query contains 4n integers a1,a2,\u2026,a4n (1\u2264ai\u2264104), where ai is the length of the i-th stick.\r\n\r\nOutput\r\nFor each query print the answer to it. If it is impossible to create exactly n rectangles of equal area using given sticks, print \"NO\". Otherwise print \"YES\".\r\n\r\nExample\r\ninput\r\n5\r\n1\r\n1 1 10 10\r\n2\r\n10 5 2 10 1 1 2 5\r\n2\r\n10 5 1 10 5 1 1 1\r\n2\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n1\r\n10000 10000 10000 10000\r\noutput\r\nYES\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\nYES\r\nYES\r\n\r\n### **Describe your change:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add an algorithm?\r\n- [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n- [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n#### References\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any reference to previous pull-request or issue -->\r\n\r\n### **Checklist:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

The existing BST implementations used primitive type `int`, however, `SortAlgorithm` interface requires sorting for any type that extends the `Comparable` interface. Therefore, generic type implementation of BST was required to facilitate Tree Sort.\r\n- Adds proper package names to [/DataStructures/Trees/BSTIterative](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/blob/master/DataStructures/Trees/BSTIterative.java) and [/DataStructures/Trees/BSTRecursive](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/blob/master/DataStructures/Trees/BSTRecursive.java) classes.\r\n- modify the class being used in `main()` function of [/DataStructures/Trees/BSTRecursive](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/blob/master/DataStructures/Trees/BSTRecursive.java) from `BSTIterative` to `BSTRecursive`. Before this change, `BSTRecursive` was testing `BSTIterative` in its `main()` method which was clearly not correct.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add an algorithm?\r\n- [x] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n- [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n#### References\r\nIssue #2603.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any reference to previous pull-request or issue -->\r\n\r\n### **Checklist:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\r\n\r\n* [x] Add an algorithm?\r\n\r\n### **Checklist:**\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Most of the available implementations use algorithms with Electronic Codebook (ECB) and this algorithm has vulnerabilities in the reliability of the generated messages that are known to the community.\r\n\r\nThis example encourages the use of a more complete encryption method than the standard ones.\r\nFor block cipher encryption algorithms (like AES), the GCM (Galois Counter Mode) mode, which works internally with zero / no padding scheme, is recommended. At the opposite, these modes and / or schemes are highly discouraged:\r\n\r\n- Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode is vulnerable because it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality: under a given key any given plaintext block always gets encrypted to the same ciphertext block.\r\n\r\n- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) with PKCS # 5 padding (or PKCS # 7) is susceptible to padding oracle attacks. RSA encryption algorithm should be used with the recommended padding scheme (OAEP)\r\n\r\nThis issue is describe by SonnarLint in https://community.sonarsource.com/t/java-s5542-has-invalid-compliant-example/21683\r\n\r\n* [x] Add an algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n* [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n#### References\r\nGalois/Counter Mode - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode\r\nWhat's the difference between AES-CBC and AES-GCM? - https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/helpdesk/kb/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-aes-cbc-and-aes-gcm\r\nJava AES/GCM/NoPadding - What is cipher.getIV() giving me? - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31851612/java-aes-gcm-nopadding-what-is-cipher-getiv-giving-me \r\n### **Checklist:**\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Some of them were violations of the below rules:\r\n\r\n- Local variable names in java must be with the  default regular expression ^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$ [RSPEC-117](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/tag/convention/RSPEC-117)\r\n- The diamond operator (\"<>\") should be used when the type of the maps are already defined [RSPEC-2293](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-2293)\r\n- Package names being camel cased is a code smell, all package names must be lowercase\r\n- String literals should not be duplicated [RSPEC-1192](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-1192)\r\n- Generic types shouldn't be used raw (without type parameters) in variable declarations or return values. Doing so bypasses generic type checking, and defers the catch of unsafe code to runtime. [RSPEC-3740](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-3740)\r\n- The dangling else problem appears when nested if/else statements are written without curly braces. In this case, else is associated with the nearest if but that is not always obvious and sometimes the indentation can also be misleading.[RSPEC-5261](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/tag/confusing/RSPEC-5261)\r\n\r\nHere is the overall SonarQube report for the repo (Development) branch post the fixes.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51189926/90881751-6c68e700-e3c8-11ea-901c-4b5fca9449c4.png)\r\n\r\nThis pull request brings down the code smells from 188 to 177.\r\n",

Thus Comb Sort removes more than one inversion counts with one swap and performs better than Bubble Sort.\r\n\r\nThe shrink factor has been empirically found to be 1.3 (by testing CombSort on over 200,000 random lists) [Source: Wiki]\r\n\r\nAlthough, it works better than Bubble Sort on average, worst case remains O(n2).",

I understand now that we can not use built in reverse function, but using recursion is still the worst way we could do the task of String reversal. Everytime we call the reverse method we are placing an extra frame on our stack. This uses space. We also create another string that we are appending our result to with the recursive solution, which is slow because under the hood, Java will create a new empty String and then append each character to the new String, one char at a time. If we do this for each character, then asymtotically we now have time complexity of O(n^2).  Recursion in this case also does not make our solution \"simpler\" or \"more elegant\". We want to use recursion when it is advantageous to do so....like traversing trees",
