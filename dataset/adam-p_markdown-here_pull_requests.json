(Issue #317)\n\nIt almost-but-not-quite works in this initial PR.  The event listeners are set up and work properly, both for clicking the **Send** button and for using the send hotkeys (which are the same in Fastmail as Gmail).  The script correctly catches and prevents sending an unrendered email when I click **Send**.  But if I use the \u2318+Enter hotkey, the email is sent _and then_ Markdown Here opens the forgot to render prompt.  It seems that `eatEvent()` is not eating the hotkey send action.\n\nI have no prior experience with JavaScript, so I thought I would stop here and ask you for guidance.  In fact, this is also my first submission to an open source project.\n\nMichael\n",

        "body": "Hi Adam,\n\nI'm a Computer Engineering student from UBC and I just wanted to say thank you for contributing Markdown Here. I started using MDH this semester for taking notes in my classes with Evernote and it's been an incredible tool. Having Markdown has made notetaking for my programming-related classes much more natural - it feels like I'm just writing documentation for a lecture!\n\nFor my Software Engineering class, we have a project where we make a contribution to an open source project on GitHub. I convinced my group to contribute to yours. We picked Enhancement #258 as a suitable starting point for the codebase.\n\nThis is the work we have so far, and we've decided to pull request it to you for feedback if we're going in the right direction. We're in the process of learning the mocha framework so we can add tests, you'll see them added to this pull request in a day or so. We also aren't sure what direction we should take for Firefox and were hoping to get some ideas from you.\n\nHere is a picture of the \"Render Available\" badge, which indicates to the user that there is Markdown ready to be rendered:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5429930/11435643/78848f84-9491-11e5-8c2e-94cdfbfd8f62.png)\n",

I just wanted to get some opinion on this thing, just to be sure I'm not making something that I'll have to trash later...\n\nWhile, I realize that I forgot about the translation-related stuff in the current state of the page, it should be trivial to add, given that I reuse the original text, which I obivously intend to.\n\nI just wanted to ask if it is OK if I re-arrange the files used by options.html so that the folder is more organized. (Someone will need to run :eyes: to make sure I don't break something...)\n\n/cc @rafegoldberg @adam-p\n",

        "body": "This (tiny) PR addresses #219, however whether you merge is at your discretion because of the behaviour I noticed when testing:\n- When composing a new mail in gmail, the signature is inserted within a DOM element that has the `gmail_signature` class. The couple of lines I've added will detect the signature & skip the DOM recursion.\n- After saving the mail as a draft and closing your browser tab, all of the classes on the email's markup are lost. As such, **when returning to an old draft from a previous browsing session, this method of signature detection fails**.\n\nI'm therefore in two minds as to whether this would be a beneficial thing; on the one hand, custom gmail signatures that weren't currently working will work without the need to prefix with `--`, but on the other, users may experience this sort of signature being parsed as markdown intermittently, which might be more confusing than the previous consistent inclusion.\n",
