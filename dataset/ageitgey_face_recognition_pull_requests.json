I used the `.yml` extension for this particular case because I'm not sure if you have any Actions or other code relying on a `*.yml` pattern match.\r\n\r\n### Docker can't promise it will work\r\n\r\nEven though current versions of [Docker Compose (~v2)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/) are *technically* backwards-compatible with the old naming conventions, the [Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/03-compose-file/#the-compose-file) states:\r\n> \"The default path for a Compose file is `compose.yaml` (preferred) or `compose.yml` in working directory. Compose implementations __*SHOULD*__ also support `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.yml` for backward compatibility. If both files exist, Compose implementations MUST prefer canonical `compose.yaml` one.\"\r\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *-Docker Docs*\r\n\r\nThe operative term being __*SHOULD*__.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compose v1 to be Removed\r\n\r\nAlso I'm not sure if this will effect the backwards compatibility of the `docker-compose.yaml` file, but according to [Docker's official docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/) (posted in an \u26a0\ufe0f __Important__ note):\r\n> \"From the end of June 2023 Compose V1 won\u2019t be supported anymore and will be removed from all Docker Desktop versions.\"\r\n\r\nHope this helps. I look forward to playing with this wonderful tool.",

The next version of ``cryptography`` will drop support\n  for it.\n* Deprecated support for Python 3.5. This version sees very little use and will\n  be removed in the next release.\n* ``backend`` arguments to functions are no longer required and the\n  default backend will automatically be selected if no ``backend`` is provided.\n* Added initial support for parsing certificates from PKCS7 files with\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  and\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  .\n* Calling ``update`` or ``update_into`` on\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext` with ``data``\n  longer than 2\\ :sup:`31` bytes no longer raises an ``OverflowError``. This\n  also resolves the same issue in :doc:`/fernet`.\n<p>.. _v3-0:</p>\n<p>3.0 - 2020-07-20\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
