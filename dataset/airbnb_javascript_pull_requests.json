I took the initiative to submit a [\"Pull Requests\"](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/pull/2724) adding it in a separate roadmap section.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and effort in maintaining this valuable resource :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMouaaz",

And you shouldn't be forced to make a component a public export if it's really just an internal implementation detail of another component.\r\n\r\nThere's an argument to be made about _exporting_ multiple components, but mostly just in the context of React.lazy because it can only import default exports and you don't want something else in that file being statically imported (because that will prevent it from being code-split).\r\n\r\nRe: https://twitter.com/ljharb/status/1096126116069138432",

        "body": "I hear you like linting! Why not enforce consistent style for your Markdown prose too?\r\n\r\nLike JavaScript linting, Markdown linting can help identify errors or constructs that not all Markdown renderers handle correctly. The linter caught a few bugs in the README.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with any of how I've gone about this, please let me know, and I'm happy to change things.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with the intent of this completely, then oh well, it was a fun exercise. :smile: \r\n\r\n## Lint Rules\r\n\r\nMy intent is to codify the existing style being used, rather than to try to change how Markdown is written in this repo.\r\n\r\n1. I've set a catchall to enable all of the [Markdownlint Rules](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/master/doc/Rules.md) and subsequently disabled ones that don't apply. If you'd instead like an explicit list of rules that do apply (to avoid updates to markdownlint silently adding new rules), I can do that instead.\r\n1. I disabled a rule when it appeared that one of the documents deliberately did not conform to it. (Even if this nonconformance only happened once, I disabled the rule globally rather than for that one occurrence in the document).\r\n1. I changed document content to fix rule nonconformance when it appeared that:\r\n   * There was a legitimate bug in the document (meaning either GitHub or another Markdown renderer would not render something correctly)\r\n   * A rule was followed consistently, except for a few isolated cases\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nA new `lint` npm script has been added to the top-level `package.json`, and set as a `pretest` script, to match how `lint` scripts in subpackages are handled. The top-level `travis` script now also explicitly invokes `lint`.\r\n\r\nThere is now a devDependency on `markdownlint-cli` but not `markdownlint`. The [JavaScript implementation of Markdownlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdownlint) is a library only, and unfortunately the CLI wrapper `markdownlint-cli` has a dependency, rather than a peerDependency, on `markdownlint`.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

It would throw errors on the 1st line of code stating there was no rule defined for `no-multi-assign`. When I added a rule in my local `.eslintrc.json` it simply delivered the same error in whatever level I declared. The only way for me to get rid of it was to set it to `0`; which was less than ideal since I wanted it to be where you have it, at `2` (`error`).\r\n\r\nI eventually traced it all the way back to this config as our own config extends this one, changed the array to a string in the live project and it finally stopped throwing inline errors in Atom.\r\n\r\nI will say that it's odd that the CLI didn't report an issue...so perhaps it's just an Atom interpretation issue of having an array with no other values.",

        "body": "## A mostly reasonable approach to ES6\n\nDon't want to read the updates in diff form? Read the ES6 style guide in full [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6).\n### Introduction\n\nWelcome to the future. This PR updates our style guide to reflect the current style for writing ES6 at Airbnb. As before, this is a living document and it'll change over time as we and the community learn. Of course, this isn't the \"one true way to write ES6\" and doesn't intend to be\u2014just one _mostly_ reasonable approach.\n\nWe think having a style guide is important for readability of code and scalability of engineering teams. Our philosophy is that you shouldn't be able to tell who wrote a file based on the style of the code.\n\nAs always, please fork this guide and use it as a starting point for your own style guide, and if you hit on a problem or something you'd like to share, we welcome [Issues](/airbnb/javascript/issues/new) and [Pull Requests](/airbnb/javascript/compare)\u2014we love having discussions about this stuff.\n### What's New\n\nWe've updated existing sections to reflect ES6 best practices (i.e., `var` -> `const`) and added guides for the following language features:\n- [Arrow Functions](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#arrow-functions)\n- [Classes](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#constructors)\n- [Object Shorthand](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-object-shorthand)\n- [Object Concise](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-object-concise)\n- [Object Computed Properties](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-computed-properties)\n- [Template Strings](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-template-literals)\n- [Destructuring](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#destructuring)\n- [Default Parameters](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-default-parameters)\n- [Rest](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-rest)\n- [Array Spreads](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#es6-array-spreads)\n- [Let and Const](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#references)\n- [Iterators and Generators](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#iterators-and-generators)\n- [Modules](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6#modules)\n### ES5 Support\n\nWe'll continue to maintain the ES5 style guide at [`/es5/README.md`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6/es5). We moved the ES5 style guide into its own folder because Airbnb is moving towards ES6, and since this public repo is the style guide we use internally, we'd like it to reflect our current best practices.  We'll also be adding additional style guides that we use internally, like our in-progress React+JSX style guide.\n### Learn ES6\n\nSome resources we've found helpful in learning ES6:\n- [ECMAScript Language Specification Draft](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html)\n- [ES6 Features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)\n- [Exploring JS](http://exploringjs.com)\n- [ES6 Compatibility Table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)\n### Compiling ES6\n\nIf you'd like to use ES6 syntax in a reasonable set of current browsers, you'll have to transpile your code to ES5. We recommend both [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) and [babel](http://babeljs.io) as activley-maintained, standards-compliant ES6 compilers. We use Babel internally.\n### FAQ\n\nWhat happened to the old guide?\n\n> It's still here! Have a look: [`/es5/README.md`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6/es5)\n\nShould I be writing ES6?\n\n>  Up to you and your team! We're making the switch at Airbnb. Check out our ES5 style guide if you're not making the jump yet.\n\nWhy does JavaScript need a style guide?\n\n> A great question, see: [#102](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/102)\n### Next Steps\n\nThe plan is to merge this after a week or so of gathering feedback from the community. Have a look and let us know your thoughts.\n\n[Read the ES6 style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6)\n\nSpecial thanks go out to @iamnirav, @alvinsng, @hshoff, @justjake, and @spikebrehm for looking at a draft of this.\n\nFixes part of #247.\n\n:hamburger: :fries: \n",

For example, this is very confusing:\n\n``` javascript\nvar volume = 10;\nif(louder)\n  volume = 12;\n  console.log(volume);\n```\n\nSo I left multi-line blocks as needing curly braces.\n",
