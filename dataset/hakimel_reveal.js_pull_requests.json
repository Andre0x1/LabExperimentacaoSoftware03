In other themes, the li renders differently depending on the nesting level (disc, square, circle).\r\n\r\nBy replacing `:before` pseudo elements with `::marker` selector, we can have the same style as in other themes :\r\n<img width=\"1047\" alt=\"dracula-list-item-comparison\" src=\"https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/assets/10920280/228d0084-c318-4afe-9776-113bb9b424ab\">\r\n\r\nfrom left to right : before this PR / PR / original \"dark\" theme for comparison\r\n\r\n**NB:**  The bullets are now bigger than before this PR, but it is consistent with other themes.

        "body": "livereload in latest version is  a lot slower than in previous versions : one has to wait 1-4s when saving html or md file to see the result in the browser.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to get back to instant refresh, as it was in previous versions of Reveal (as on 3.6, 3.9, 4.0).\r\n\r\nThe reason of the drop in performance is this commit : https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/commit/8492b82d12735969c07a96b0bfd81860fb30862f#diff-25789e3ba4c2adf4a68996260eb693a441b4a834c38b76167a120f0b51b969f7R289\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngulp.task('reload', () => gulp.src(['**/*.html', '**/*.md'])\r\n    .pipe(connect.reload()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy passing `**/*.html` and `**/*.md` it looks like (I'm no gulp expert) we force gulp to crawl recursively every folder in the project, searching for html or md files. And this makes a lot of files even in the base reveal.js project (node_modules is not excluded \ud83d\ude30).\r\n\r\nThis crawling seems quite useless because this task is not responsible for the watch, all it does is telling the browser to refresh. Still, the `connect.reload()` API needs a stream of files to execute (I tried many ways to launch it without `gulp.src(...)` before with no success). \r\nSince the src stream is irrelevant, I made `gulp.src` only crawl the original `index.html` file, and everything works fine : when modifying a file, even if it's not the base `index.html` file, the browser refreshes instantly, and shows every modifications made.\r\n\r\nHere is an approximative bench on my dev computer (macbook pro M1Pro, RAM 32Go), measuring time from file save, to modification shown in browser (may differ from timing showed in terminal) :\r\n- old config : 1000-3000ms, **thousands** (!!!) of network request fired from the browser (all cancelled) \ud83d\ude31  \r\n- new config : 10-50ms, no additional network requests \ud83e\udd73 ",

They're based on your `black.scss` and `white.scss`, with modifications\r\n- headers are verbatim (rather than in CAPITAL CASE) - useful when the words/terms are in CamelCase or mixed;\r\n- compact (less spacing) - using the screen more;\r\n- high contrast (pure black on pure white, and vice-versa).\r\n\r\nThis would help my existing presentation (https://peter-kehl.github.io/no_std_rust_libs = https://github.com/peter-kehl/no_std_rust_libs) and 18+ more presentations to come (https://github.com/peter-kehl/no_std_patterns).\r\n\r\nCould there be a better way to organize/centralize the code shared between `black.scss` and `black_contrast_compact_verbatim_headers.scss` (and between `white.scss` and `white_contrast_compact_verbatim_headers.scss`), please do as you see fit.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance either way.

The timeout is needed because there is no promise at the moment that the deck is actually fullscreen. \r\nThe second part is the styling on the 'multiple-presentations' page, which sets the 50vh on the parent, not the deck itself, because Safari will not go full-fullscreen when a height is set on it. This parent-styling should also be implemented on the revealjs.com pages.\r\n\r\nIt does not fix the 'remote button' issue (as discussed in that same issue), because that will need either an event listener on fullscreen changes (which is not built in (yet)), or the possibility to both focus the target deck AND simulate an F keypress at the same time.",

See https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1027 or https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/2179. \r\n\r\nI've been facing the same issue recently when trying to play `Reveal.js` presentations on some IoT-type devices (android board, with WebView) and even from my phone (Samsung, Android 11, both Samsung Internet and Brave) \r\n\r\nCould not easily reproduce the problem because of also using embedded videos (full screen) that where properly working. \r\n\r\nUntil I spotted a slight difference between the two video injection: the background video didn't have `type` added to the `source` tag generated from the `data-background-video` attribute in `Reveal.js`\r\n\r\nThe solution in this PR seems to be fixing the problem on all my devices. I cannot explain why it is working (or bugging in the first place), nor whether it will now work on every devices, including older versions of OS or browsers.\r\n\r\nAlso, worth noting that the solution in this PR is simply generating the MIME type out of the file extension, which is not a very reliable solution.

        "body": "This PR implements both `data-auto-animate-id` and `data-auto-animate-restart`, allowing for finer control of auto animate.\r\n\r\n* When at least one of two successive `data-auto-animate` slides has a `data-auto-animate-id` attribute, both need to have the same attribute value in order for auto animate to trigger\r\n* When a `data-auto-animate` slide has a `data-auto-animate-restart` attribute, auto animate does not trigger on the transition between the previous slide and it, but _does_ trigger on the transition between it and the next slide. `data-auto-animate-restart` always negatively overrides auto animate, even breaking two slides with the same `data-auto-animate-id` apart. Note that \"previous\" and \"next\" are meant physically, so \"previous\" always means a slide to the left or the top of the current one and \"next\" always means a slide to the right or the bottom instead of \"previously shown slide\" and \"next slide to show\" (which might go in any direction, breaking `data-auto-animate-restart` which isn't symmetric)\r\n\r\nThis design is rather flexible and doesn't introduce a breaking change (apart from new attribute names being used by reveal.js): `data-auto-animate` slide pairs without `data-auto-animate-id` and `data-auto-animate-restart` behave just like before\r\n\r\nWhy both `data-auto-animate-id` and `data-auto-animate-restart`, wouldn't one be enough?\r\nIn theory yes, but I think having both is handy. Only `data-auto-animate-restart` would result in an unreadable hell for any non-trivial presentations with multiple auto-animate groups right next to each other and requires a lot of attention to not accidentally mess up the exact break points. While only having `data-auto-animate-id` would require annotating possibly two dozen slides with a different id when all you want is one simple auto animate break in the middle.\r\n\r\nExamples: (Slide pairs with different letters won't auto animate)\r\n```html\r\n<section data-auto-animate>A1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>A2</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-restart>B1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>B2</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"a\">A1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"a\">A2</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>B1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>B2</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"c\">C1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"c\">C2</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"a\">A1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"a\">A2</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"b\">B1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"b\">B2</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"1\">A1</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"1\">A2</section>\r\n<section>\r\n    <section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"2\">Vertical B1</section>\r\n    <section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"2\">Vertical B2</section>\r\n    <section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"2\" data-auto-animate-restart>Vertical C1</section>\r\n    <section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id=\"2\">Vertical C2</section>\r\n</section>\r\n<section data-auto-animate>D1</section>\r\n<section>E1</section>\r\n```",

When using r-stretch the image should be resized vertically that the whole slide is covered. However, having a landscape formated image, this is not possible. In order to achive that the whole slide is covered, I would suppose to add a top and bottom padding to the image. This pull request extends the `layoutSlideContents()` method and adds an appropriate padding to landscape images. \r\n\r\nIn the following zip file one can find an example index.html together with a portrait picuture and a landscape picture.\r\n[reveal.js.zip](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/files/5558494/reveal.js.zip)\r\n\r\nThis pull request also contains the fix of a minor bug  within the `getRemainingHeight()` method from utils.js. Without this bug fix it may happen in some cases that the image height is accidentally set to 0.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, it would be great to define a more detailed custom layout by editing the `layoutSlideContents()` method. However, digging into the reveal.js file and making your custom changes is not very convinient. I think it would be a great feature if there exists the possiblitiy to inject a custom layout method through the reveal configuration. Maybe it is possible to think of such a feature in the future.",

It's not ready to merge just yet, but it's getting close.\r\n\r\nThe main changes in this release are:\r\n- New website, docs and logo https://revealjs.com\r\n- Modernized reveal.js core. The old reveal.js file with 6.2k lines of code (!) was refactored and split into ES modules.\r\n- You can now run multiple reveal.js presentations on the same page.  \r\n  ```javascript\r\n  import Reveal from 'reveal.js'\r\n  let deck1 = new Reveal( document.querySelector( '.deck1' ) );\r\n  let deck2 = new Reveal( document.querySelector( '.deck2' ) );\r\n  deck1.initialize({ embedded: true });\r\n  deck2.initialize({ embedded: true });\r\n  ```\r\n- Converted all plugins to ES modules so that they can be bundled with reveal.js.\r\n- All plugins and reveal.js core are transpiled to ES5 for situations where you need to support older browsers.\r\n- Switched build systems from grunt to gulp (using rollup for bundling).\r\n- Added a major new Auto-Animate feature.\r\n- Added a new `slidetransitionend` event.\r\n- `Reveal.add/removeEventListener` -> `Reveal.on/off`.\r\n- Added support for code line numbers and highlights using Markdown\r\n- The initialize method now returns a promise that resolves when reveal.js has started ```Reveal.initialize().then( () => console.log( 'ready' ) )```.\r\n- The highlight.js and marked libraries are now installed from npm. They were previously hard coded inside their corresponding plugins in this repository.\r\n\r\nThere are a few breaking changes in this release:\r\n- All compiled assets (reveal.js, reveal.css, themes) have moved to /dist.\r\n- Print stylesheets are now baked into the reveal.css file so there is no need to separately include them in the presentation HTML.\r\n- The multiplex and server side speakers notes plugins have moved out to separate repos and can be installed via npm:\r\n  https://github.com/reveal/multiplex \r\n  https://github.com/reveal/notes-server\r\n\r\nDocs, upgrade instructions and a new revealjs.com will follow when it's ready to merge but hopefully this gives you an idea of what's to come! \u270c\ufe0f",

The pacing timer will then continue to allocate the exact pacing time for slides that do have `data-timing` set, as before. However, rather than applying the `defaultTiming` constant to all others, it will\r\n\r\n- Add up the time already allocated to slides via `data-timing`;\r\n- subtract that from totalTime;\r\n- divide the difference by the number of slides *without* `data-timing` set;\r\n- apply the thus-calculated average to those slides.\r\n\r\n`totalTime` has no default, and if both `defaultTiming` and `totalTime` are set, `totalTime wins`. This preserves backward compatibility: if a presenter has set `defaultTiming` and updates reveal.js, `totalTime` will be `null` and `defaultTiming` is still applied to all slides without a `data-timing` attribute. The presenter can then switch to the automatic calculation, if desired, by setting a value for `totalTime`.\r\n",

Use `config.controls` to control whether or not the button is shown.\r\n2. Let the entire `dom.pauseOverlay` listen for clicks and close when clicked.\r\n\r\nThis is just one way you could approach this. You could also introduce a new config for the button, but I thought it made good sense to use the `controls`.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.",

This PR updates to check for 'onpointerdown' in window instead, and removes conditionality on event removal (since it is safe to removeEventListener even when the event is not registered).  Doing so enables swipe navigation to work on Edge.\r\n\r\nThis PR also reorders the conditional to prioritize use of pointer events (when available) over touch events.  Since pointer events don't necessitate main-thread handling due to event registration alone, this opens opportunities for slide authors to restrict swipe behavior from portions of their content and retain off-thread panning performance for overflow content if they desire, via scoped application of the CSS touch-action property.",

Unlike Reveal.registerKeyboardShortcut() when key bindings are removed they are also removed from the help overlay\r\n- reduces the need for plugins to directly add `keydown` event listeners that can't be overridden by user defined bindings using `keyboard` config option\r\n- incorporates API usage into notes plugin (should fix #1832 and #1630)\r\n- passes `keydown` event to config.keyboardCondition() to allow plugins to filter keyboard based on keycodes. Use case: the reveal.js-menu plugin blocks Reveal keyboard interaction (using keyboardCondition) when the menu is open but using the key binding API to toggle the menu fails to close the menu unless the 'm' key is allowed to pass through to Reveal.",

For one, I hope to provide a fix:\n\nI didn't see a background image on the very first slide containing the title and author information:\n\n```\n<body>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"reveal\">\n    <div class=\"slides\">\n\n        <section data-background-image=\"_res/kb.jpg\">\n            <h1 class=\"title\">Lernen lernen</h1>\n            <h2 class=\"author\">Jan Beilicke</h2>\n            <h3 class=\"date\">28.10.2016</h3>\n        </section>\n        ...\n```\n\nAfter some debugging, it turned out that the background existed but was set to `display: none`. After I removed the corresponding lines in `hideSlide()` it was displayed again. Afterwards, I tested the other slides with background properties set and unset and they behave as expected. I couldn't find out yet, why the background of that particular slide wasn't displayed when `showSlide()` is called. \n\nFeel free to discuss my pull request or accept it.\nCheers,\n//jotbe\n",

I recommend you also monitor the project by running [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/#wizard), that will alert you when a new vulnerability that affects your dependencies is disclosed.\n\nLastly, to show the world you're doing a good job on security (and that they should care), I took the liberty of adding a badge stating you're free of known vulnerabilities. If you're gonna be awesome, no reason to hide it!\nNote that the badge works off the latest master branch, so it'll show red until you actually merge this in.\n\nFull disclosure: I'm a part of the Snyk team, just looking to spread some security goodness and awareness ;)\n",

Feels much more lightweight I'd say. Supports the same `$\u2026$` or `$$\u2026$$` style replacements, as well as wrapping formulas in elements.\n\nAll changes were made to the plugin directory, except the tests, which I added to `test`. README and example included.\n\nThe plugin directory includes the KaTeX build, as I saw that the `markdown` plugin did the same with `marked`. 1,1 MB is quite heavy though, due to fonts (but runs offline then). If that's too big, KaTeX could perhaps be downloaded with a grunt taks or manually instead of adding it to the repo.\n",

An explanation of how it works is in plugins/footnotes/README.md\n\nThe idea is that sometimes you need to put fixed positioned footnotes but let their content change slide by slide, especially in scientific presentations. You also then need a slide with bibliography at the end. So I've implemented this. Only thing I am not sure how to resolve yet is a bibliography longer than a sensible count, let's say 10. Perhaps by enabling scrolling inside the slide, will need to think of it, but that's easy to style by oneself if needed. Please comment, I am willing to develop this further/fix it, as I will be using this really often.\n\nNote: I've regenerated the .css files, this makes the diffs a little less readable, but if you skip the .css files which were generated, you will see a clear and readable changeset. I've also added a test index.html file to test/ to show how all of this works and sensible (I think) defaults to the original file, which does not generate bibliography but exemplifies how footnotes can be used.\n",

If the next stack does not have a slide at that index, the relevant direction arrow is disabled.\n\nMy partner is looking at using your reveal.js framework to do a \"choose your own adventure\" style interactive online story with illustrations. To do this requires the slides to transition to the same vertical index in neighbouring stacks, hence the patch :)\nI've catered for both ltr and rtl orientations, and functionally everything works as expected. \nThere are a couple of small niggles:\n1. The transition effects aren't quite clean - they do an almost diagonal transition from source slide, through next horizontal slide at position[0] then to the vertical destination slide.\n2. The overview mode still centres the vertical stacks without moving the surrounding stacks. Functionally this is still fine, but I would love to see the surrounding stacks all move in sync. There's a possibility of the stories getting quite large and complicated, and having the entire presentation moving as a unit would make creation/management a lot easier\nI have a suspicion that these may be linked but they are both out of my league to resolve -\n\nThanks for considering my patch, I'm a novice javascript programmer, git user and very rusty tertiary qualified programmer so I apologise for any rookie mistakes!\n\nRegards, \nBernard Gray\n",

I'm using `middleman` + `sprockets` + `bower` to serve the presentation and other assets. `reveal.js` is installed via `bower` as well. All assets in there go through `sprockets` and `bower`\n\nWith the path to the `reveal.js` default font (`league_gothic`) hardcoded I see no way to serve it via middleman. Therefor I introduced a scss variable (`$rv-font-path`) to make the path to the font configurable. With this in place, it is possible to serve the default font via `middleman`.\n\nTo make the use of fonts easier and to reduce redundancy I also introduced a small mixin: `rv-font-face`. Addititionally I moved the font files into a subfolder `league_gothic` to separate them from other font files which might be included by a user in their presentation.\n\nBTW: I compiled the `scss`-files and they looked very similar to the existing `css`-files.  These compiled `css`-files are _not_ part of the pull request. If you like, I can include them as well.\n\nWould you mind to take a look into this ? Thank you very much in advance.\n\nCheers,\nmaxmeyer\n",

If that attribute is found on a slide, only fragments with that attribute will be counted to get the fragment index.\n\nI thought the effect made for pretty cool presentations, but it made the notes view almost unusable as it wouldn't stay in sync with the actual presentation.

        "body": "Hi Hakim,\n\nthe new release included a nice new auto-slide control. However, the API for navigation and reading state was not updated. This is a bit inconsistent, because users can navigate using functions as `next()`, `toggleOverview()`, etc. but weren't able to pause/resume the auto-slide mode.\n\nI extended the API to support similar functionality for the new control as has already been provided for the old navigation controls. Furthermore, I think it is important to also fire events when auto-sliding is paused or resumed (one important use case could be to pause/resume media files when the  auto-slide control is played), so I added the new events `autoslideresumed` and `autoslidepaused`.\n\nHope you find these changes useful and would love to see them merged.\n\nThanks \nRaj\n",

If auto sliding is enabled and if a slide has an HTML5 media element which is played automatically, the auto slide value caused to switch to the next slide before the media files is played completely. With this change the timer is now increased if the duration of the media file is larger than the autoSlide value. With this change one can include audio files for each slide to obtain a slide show in which the next slide is automatically shown after the media file is played.\n\nI hope you consider including this small change. \n\n(Please, note that this is my first fork and pull request using Github. I hope my usage of this is appropriate. Excuse me if not).\n\nCheers\n",

I assume this also affects the notes-server plugin, but I didn't check.\n\nThe notes plugin could be changed to filter out additional events. Another is to create a single event for all displayed fragments with the same index. This pull request does just that.\n\nFor backwards-compatibility, the fragment property of the event still returns a single fragment. A new property (fragments) contains all fragments that were displayed.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",

        "body": "Hi, I recently gave a talk at my company on JavaScript, and I decided to use your awesome framework to author the slides. While I loved the functionality and style overall, I did not really feel like stuffing all my slides into a giant HTML file together with a page full of boilerplate for the setup. So \u2013\u00a0I wrote my own preprocessor to allow me to write slides in [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). \n\nI extracted the boilerplate into a template, added a simple configuration file in JSON format (`slides.json`), and extended the `Gruntfile`  with tasks for automating the compilation (Jade to HTML) process. I even included a \"watch\" task that uses `grunt-contrib-connect` to run web server at the same time to preview the presentation. One can simply run `grunt serve` and start editing the presentation, and every time you save the HTML will be updated automatically.\n## Features\n- Write reveal.js presentations in Jade instead of HTML\n- Easy configuration via JSON\n- Large presentations can be split up into multiple files\n- Markdown support\n- Built-in webserver and watch task automates compilation and simplifies preview\n## Instructions\n\nSlide content goes into the `slides` directory. Create as many `.jade` files in here as you need to. Some samples are provided.\n\nThe `slides.json` is the main project file. Edit it to change the presentation metadata (`title`, `author`, and `description`), and configure reveal.js options using the `options` key. Finally, in the `slides` array, add all your `.jade` files in the `slides` directory in the order you want them included. \n### Commands\n\n`grunt slides`: reads `slides.json` and compiles all the Jade templates listed within into HTML. Output is written to `slides.html`\n\n`grunt serve`: runs a webserver (listening on port 8000) that serves up the slides. Should work with the presenter-notes plugin. Also keeps watching for changes to `slides.json` and any file in the `slides` directory, and recompiled the presentation if anything was changed. This is the main task I use for authoring the presentation, as all I have to do is save a file and hit \"reload\" in the browser to see my changes.\n\n`grunt package`: packages the presentation and all necessary dependencies into a `.zip` file for easy sharing. In case the PDF export isn't good enough.\n## Note\n\nI'm sending you this pull request not necessarily because I want you to merge this and include it in the main distribution (unless you want to). Perhaps this should be a standalone tool that just uses reveal.js as a backend, so it doesn't add extra complexity to your code. It's up to you. However, I wasn't able to find reveal.js as a npm-installable package, so forking the project was the easiest way for me to get started. \n\nI just wanted to say thanks for your cool framework and show you something awesome I've built with it. Give it a look, try it out, and let me know what you think. :)\n",

        "body": "Thanks to @davidbanham for his help.\n## Multiplexing\n\nThe multiplex plugin allows your audience to view the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client presentations will update in real time. See a demo at [http://revealjs.jit.su/](http://revealjs.jit.su).\n\nThe multiplex plugin needs the following 3 things to operate:\n1. Master presentation that has control\n2. Client presentations that follow the master\n3. Socket.io server to broadcast events from the master to the clients\n\nMore details:\n#### Master presentation\n\nServed from a static file server accessible (preferably) only to the presenter. This need only be on your (the presenter's) computer. (It's safer to run the master presentation from your own computer, so if the venue's Internet goes down it doesn't stop the show.) An example would be to execute the following commands in the directory of your master presentation: \n1. `npm install node-static`\n2. `static`\n\nIf you want to use the speaker notes plugin with you master presentation then make sure you have the speaker notes plugin configured correctly along with the configuration shown below, then execute `node plugin/notes-server` in the directory of your master presentation. The configuration below will cause it to connect to the socket.io server as a master, as well as launch your speaker-notes/static-file server.\n\nYou can then access your master presentation at `http://localhost:1947`\n\nExample configuration:\n\n``` javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n    // other options\n\n    multiplex: {\n        // Example values. Generate your own.\n        secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation\n        id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server\n        url: 'revealjs.jit.su:80' // Location of socket.io server\n    },\n\n    // Optional libraries used to extend on reveal.js\n    dependencies: [\n        // other deps\n        { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js', async: true },\n        { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true },\n\n        // and if you want speaker notes\n        { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true }\n    ]\n});\n```\n#### Client presentation\n\nServed from a publicly accessible static file server. Examples include: GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Dreamhost, Akamai, etc. The more reliable, the better. Your audience can then access the client presentation via `http://example.com/path/to/presentation/client/index.html`, with the configuration below causing them to connect to the socket.io server as clients.\n\nExample configuration:\n\n``` javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n    // other options\n\n    multiplex: {\n        // Example values. Generate your own.\n        secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation\n        id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server\n        url: 'revealjs.jit.su:80' // Location of socket.io server\n    },\n\n    // Optional libraries used to extend on reveal.js\n    dependencies: [\n        // other deps\n        { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js', async: true },\n        { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }\n    ]\n});\n```\n#### Socket.io server\n\nServer that receives the slideChanged events from the master presentation and broadcasts them out to the connected client presentations. This needs to be publicly accessible. You can run your own socket.io server with the commands:\n1. `npm install`\n2. `node plugin/multiplex`\n\nOr you use the socket.io server at [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su).\n\nYou'll need to generate a unique secret and token pair for your master and client presentations. To do so, visit `http://example.com/token`, where `http://example.com` is the location of your socket.io server. Or if you're going to use the socket.io server at [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su), visit [http://revealjs.jit.su/token](http://revealjs.jit.su/token).\n\nYou are very welcome to point your presentations at the Socket.io server running at [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su), but availability and stability are not guaranteed. For anything mission critical I recommend you run your own server. It is simple to deploy to nodejitsu, heroku, your own environment, etc.\n##### socket.io server as file static server\n\nThe socket.io server can play the role of static file server for your client presentation, as in the example at [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su). (Open [http://revealjs.jit.su](http://revealjs.jit.su) in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match.) \n\nExample configuration:\n\n``` javascript\nReveal.initialize({\n    // other options\n\n    multiplex: {\n        // Example values. Generate your own.\n        secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation\n        id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server\n        url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server\n    },\n\n    // Optional libraries used to extend on reveal.js\n    dependencies: [\n        // other deps\n        { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.10/socket.io.min.js', async: true },\n        { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }\n    ]\n```\n\nIt can also play the role of static file server for your master presentation and client presentations at the same time (as long as you don't want to use speaker notes).

In addition to the\n\"fragment\" class, one needs to add a \"css-fragment\" class as well as a\n\"data-target\" attribute which specifies the target for the css class\naddition or removal.\nThe latter are specified using \"data-add-class\" and \"data-remove-class\".\n",

In short this just removes socket.io and uses window.postMessage.\n\nThis also has the great advantage that I no longer need to run a node server to see notes which is great for presentations hosted on github pages.\n",

As many laptops don't have PgUp/PgDn, it's also necessary to provide a mapping for Previous, which is why I added \"p\" and therefore \"n\" for consistency.\n\nI'd argue esc is more appropriate than space for the context-shift of the 3D overview.\n\nAdded vim bindings because they're convenient, some devices might not support arrow keys, and they're being used in Twitter and Google+ among other websites.\n",
