Since publication, several LangChain users have asked me if I can integrate it into LangChain to accelerate their workflows, so here I am \ud83e\udd17 \r\n\r\n## Benchmarking\r\n\r\nTo conduct benchmarks locally, run this in your Jupyter:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport scipy as sp\r\nimport simsimd as simd\r\nimport timeit as tt\r\n\r\ndef cosine_similarity_np(X: np.ndarray, Y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\r\n    X_norm = np.linalg.norm(X, axis=1)\r\n    Y_norm = np.linalg.norm(Y, axis=1)\r\n    with np.errstate(divide=\"ignore\", invalid=\"ignore\"):\r\n        similarity = np.dot(X, Y.T) / np.outer(X_norm, Y_norm)\r\n    similarity[np.isnan(similarity) | np.isinf(similarity)] = 0.0\r\n    return similarity\r\n\r\ndef cosine_similarity_sp(X: np.ndarray, Y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\r\n    return 1 - sp.spatial.distance.cdist(X, Y, metric='cosine')\r\n\r\ndef cosine_similarity_simd(X: np.ndarray, Y: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\r\n    return 1 - simd.cdist(X, Y, metric='cosine')\r\n\r\nX = np.random.randn(1, 1536).astype(np.float32)\r\nY = np.random.randn(1, 1536).astype(np.float32)\r\nrepeat = 1000\r\n\r\nprint(\"NumPy: {:,.0f} ops/s, SciPy: {:,.0f} ops/s, SimSIMD: {:,.0f} ops/s\".format(\r\n    repeat / tt.timeit(lambda: cosine_similarity_np(X, Y), number=repeat),\r\n    repeat / tt.timeit(lambda: cosine_similarity_sp(X, Y), number=repeat),\r\n    repeat / tt.timeit(lambda: cosine_similarity_simd(X, Y), number=repeat),\r\n))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nI ran this on an M2 Pro Macbook for various data types and different number of rows in `X` and reformatted the results as a table for readability:\r\n\r\n| Data Type | NumPy | SciPy | SimSIMD |\r\n| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |\r\n| `f32, 1` | 59,114 ops/s | 80,330 ops/s | 475,351 ops/s |\r\n| `f16, 1` | 32,880 ops/s | 82,420 ops/s | 650,177 ops/s |\r\n| `i8, 1` | 47,916 ops/s | 115,084 ops/s | 866,958 ops/s |\r\n| `f32, 10` | 40,135 ops/s | 24,305 ops/s | 185,373 ops/s |\r\n| `f16, 10` | 7,041 ops/s | 17,596 ops/s | 192,058 ops/s |\r\n| `f16, 10` | 21,989 ops/s | 25,064 ops/s | 619,131 ops/s |\r\n| `f32, 100` | 3,536 ops/s | 3,094 ops/s | 24,206 ops/s |\r\n| `f16, 100` | 900 ops/s | 2,014 ops/s | 23,364 ops/s |\r\n| `i8, 100` | 5,510 ops/s | 3,214 ops/s | 143,922 ops/s |\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that SimSIMD will underperform if both matrices are huge.\r\nThat, however, seems to be an uncommon usage pattern for LangChain users.\r\nYou can find a much more detailed performance report for different hardware models here:\r\n\r\n- [Apple M2 Pro](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/simsimd-faster-scipy/#appendix-1-performance-on-apple-m2-pro).\r\n- [4th Gen Intel Xeon Platinum](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/simsimd-faster-scipy/#appendix-2-performance-on-4th-gen-intel-xeon-platinum-8480).\r\n- [AWS Graviton 3](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/simsimd-faster-scipy/#appendix-3-performance-on-aws-graviton-3).\r\n  \r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n1. Previous version used `X = np.array(X)`, to repackage lists of lists. It's an anti-pattern, as it will use double-precision floating-point numbers, which are slow on both CPUs and GPUs. I have replaced it with `X = np.array(X, dtype=np.float32)`, but a more selective approach should be discussed.\r\n2. In numerical computations, it's recommended to explicitly define tolerance levels, which were previously avoided in `np.allclose(expected, actual)` calls. For now, I've set absolute tolerance to distance computation errors as 0.01: `np.allclose(expected, actual, atol=1e-2)`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n  - **Dependencies:** adds `simsimd` dependency\r\n  - **Tag maintainer:** @hwchase17\r\n  - **Twitter handle:** @ashvardanian ",

We are unable to run `from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS` with SQLAlchemy <1.4.0 due to top-level imports, even if we aren't even using parts of the library that use SQLAlchemy. See Testing section for repro. Let's make it so that langchain is still compatible with SQLAlchemy <1.4.0, especially if we aren't using parts of langchain that require it.\r\n\r\nThe main conflict is that SQLAlchemy removed `declarative_base` from `sqlalchemy.ext.declarative` in 1.4.0 and moved it to `sqlalchemy.orm`. We can fix this by try-catching the import. This is the same fix as applied in https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/883.\r\n\r\n(I see that there seems to be some refactoring going on about isolating dependencies, e.g. https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/commit/c87e9fb2ce0ae617e3b2edde52421c80adef54cc, so if this issue will be eventually fixed by isolating imports in langchain.vectorstores that also works).\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nI can't find a matching issue.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nNo additional dependencies\r\n\r\n## Maintainer\r\n@hwchase17 since you reviewed https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/883\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nI didn't add a test, but I manually tested this.\r\n\r\n1.

The new type hints explicitly declare that only those values are supported.\n- The return type was type-hinted as `Sequence` but using `fetch = \"one\"` would actually return a single result item. This was incorrectly suppressed using `# type: ignore`. We now always return a list.\n- Using `fetch = \"one\"` would return a single item if data was found, or an empty *list* if no data was found. This was confusing, and we now always return a list to simplify.\n- The return type was `Sequence[Any]` which was a bit difficult to use since it wasn't clear what one could do with the returned rows. I'm making the new type `Dict[str, Any]` that corresponds to the column names and their values in the query.\n\nI've updated the use of this method elsewhere in the file to match the new behavior.\n",

Instead, the `RefreshError: ('invalid_grant: Bad Request', {'error': 'invalid_grant', 'error_description': 'Bad Request'})` error happens. Setting it via `os.environ[\"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\"] = ...` solves the problem. Also, `token_path` constructor parameter is mandatory, otherwise another error happens when trying to `load()` for the first time.\r\n\r\nThese errors are tricky and time-consuming to figure out, so I believe it's good to mention them in the docs.",

So instead of changing Document class to have embedding_content, I mimicked the implementation of faiss.py.\r\n      - The test should provide some guidance on how to use it. It would be more intuitive if I just pass texts and embedding_texts as separate arguments, but I chose to use `zip`-ed object for the consistency with faiss.py implementation.\r\n      - I plan to make similar pull request for OpenSearch.\r\n  - **Issue:** N/A\r\n  - **Dependencies:** None other than the existing ones.",

        "body": "**Description:** \r\nThis commit enriches the `WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever` class by introducing a new parameter, `hybrid_search_kwargs`, within the `_get_relevant_documents` method. This parameter accommodates arbitrary keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) which can be channeled to the inherited public method, `get_relevant_documents`, originating from the `BaseRetriever` class. \r\n\r\nThis modification facilitates more intricate querying capabilities, allowing users to convey supplementary arguments to the `.with_hybrid()` method. This expansion not only makes it possible to perform a more nuanced search targeting specific properties but also grants the ability to boost the weight of searched properties, to carry out a search with a custom vector, and to apply the Fusion ranking method. The documentation has been updated accordingly to delineate these new possibilities in detail.\r\n\r\nIn light of the layered approach in which this search operates, initiating with `query.get()` and then transitioning to `.with_hybrid()`, several advantageous opportunities are unlocked for the hybrid component that were previously unattainable. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a representative example showcasing a query structure that was formerly unfeasible:\r\n\r\n[Specific Properties Only](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid#selected-properties-only)\r\n\"The example below illustrates a BM25 search targeting the keyword 'food' exclusively within the 'question' property, integrated with vector search results corresponding to 'food'.\"\r\n```python\r\nresponse = (\r\n    client.query\r\n    .get(\"JeopardyQuestion\", [\"question\", \"answer\"])\r\n    .with_hybrid(\r\n        query=\"food\",\r\n        properties=[\"question\"], # Will now be possible moving forward\r\n        alpha=0.25\r\n    )\r\n    .with_limit(3)\r\n    .do()\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis functionality is now accessible through my alterations, by conveying `hybrid_search_kwargs={\"properties\": [\"question\", \"answer\"]}` as an argument to `WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever.get_relevant_documents()`. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nfrom weaviate import Client\r\nfrom langchain.retrievers import WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever\r\n\r\nclient = Client(\r\n        url=os.getenv(\"WEAVIATE_CLIENT_URL\"),\r\n        additional_headers={\r\n            \"X-OpenAI-Api-Key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),\r\n            \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('WEAVIATE_API_KEY')}\",\r\n        },\r\n    )\r\n\r\nindex_name = \"Document\"\r\ntext_key = \"content\"\r\nattributes = [\"title\", \"summary\", \"header\", \"url\"]\r\n\r\nretriever = ExtendedWeaviateHybridSearchRetriever(\r\n        client=client,\r\n        index_name=index_name,\r\n        text_key=text_key,\r\n        attributes=attributes,\r\n    )\r\n\r\n# Warning: to utilize properties in this way, each use property must also be in the list `attributes + [text_key]`.\r\nhybrid_search_kwargs = {\"properties\": [\"summary^2\", \"content\"]}\r\nquery_text = \"Some Query Text\"\r\n\r\nrelevant_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(\r\n        query=query_text,\r\n        hybrid_search_kwargs=hybrid_search_kwargs\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nIn my experience working with the `weaviate-client` library, I have found that these supplementary options stand as vital tools for refining/finetuning searches, notably within multifaceted datasets. As a final note, this implementation supports both backwards and forward (within reason) compatiblity. It accommodates any future additional parameters Weaviate may add to `.with_hybrid()`, without necessitating further alterations.\r\n\r\n**Additional Documentation:**\r\nFor a more comprehensive understanding and to explore a myriad of useful options that are now accessible, please refer to the Weaviate documentation:\r\n- [Fusion Ranking Method](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid#fusion-ranking-method)\r\n- [Selected Properties Only](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid#selected-properties-only)\r\n- [Weight Boost Searched Properties](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid#weight-boost-searched-properties)\r\n- [With a Custom Vector](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid#with-a-custom-vector)\r\n\r\n**Tag Maintainer:** \r\n@hwchase17 - I have tagged you based on your frequent contributions to the pertinent file, `/retrievers/weaviate_hybrid_search.py`. My apologies if this was not the appropriate choice.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my contribution, I look forward to your feedback, and to future collaboration.",

Here is my use-case that triggered this change.  \r\n  \r\n  I have a `ConversationBufferMemory` that is backed by a `FileChatMessageHistory`:\r\n```python\r\nvectorstore = get_vectorstore()\r\nchat_history = FileChatMessageHistory(\"chat_memory_path/session.json\")\r\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\", chat_memory=chat_history, return_messages=True)\r\nqa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(\r\n    get_chat_model(),\r\n    vectorstore.as_retriever(),\r\n    return_source_documents=True,\r\n    memory=memory,\r\n)\r\n```\r\nwhere `get_chat_model()` returns a LLM and `vectorstore` is your favorite Vector store.  \r\n\r\nA problem occurs when `BaseConversationalRetrievalChain._get_chat_history()` is called.  In my setup, `chat_history` is an instance of `FileChatMessageHistory` and `_get_chat_history()` tries to create an iterator from it (see this [line](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/conversational_retrieval/base.py#L37)).  I could supply my own callable version when building the chain, but it kind of made sense to me that a chat history would be iterable.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for input on how to make this pass in `mypy` since it complains with the following:\r\n```\r\nlangchain/memory/chat_message_histories/in_memory.py:10: error: Definition of \"__iter__\" in base class \"BaseChatMessageHistory\" is incompatible with definition in base class \"BaseModel\"  [misc]\r\n```",

This is because the deduplication of input documents [doc1_1, doc1_2, doc1_2, doc2] is [doc1_1, doc1_2, doc2]. So `index` insert doc1_1, doc1_2, doc1_2 with the uid of doc1_1, doc1_2, doc2.",

However, it's not restrictive, allowing for integration of alternative frameworks such as [Stanza](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/analyzer/nlp_engines/spacy_stanza/) or [transformers](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/analyzer/nlp_engines/transformers/) when necessary.\r\n\r\n### Future works\r\n\r\n- **automatic language detection** - instead of passing the language as a parameter in `anonymizer.anonymize`, we could detect the language/s beforehand and then use the corresponding NER model. We have discussed this internally and @mateusz-wosinski-ds will look into a standalone language detection tool/chain for LangChain :smile: \r\n\r\n### Twitter handle\r\n@deepsense_ai / @MaksOpp\r\n\r\n### Tag maintainer\r\n@baskaryan @hwchase17 @hinthornw ",

Let me know if I can provide any other additional information or do things differently in the future to make your lives easier \ud83d\ude4f _\r\n\r\n@hwchase17 please let me know if you're not the right person to review \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nThis PR enables LangChain to access the Konko API via the chat_models API wrapper. \r\n\r\nKonko API is a fully managed API designed to help application developers:\r\n\r\n1. Select the right LLM(s) for their application\r\n2. Prototype with various open-source and proprietary LLMs\r\n3. Move to production in-line with their security, privacy, throughput, latency SLAs without infrastructure set-up or administration using Konko AI's SOC 2 compliant infrastructure\r\n\r\n_Note on integration tests:_ \r\nWe added 14 integration tests. They will all fail unless you export the right API keys. 13 will pass with a KONKO_API_KEY provided and the other one will pass with a OPENAI_API_KEY provided. When both are provided, all 14 integration tests pass. If you would like to test this yourself, please let me know and I can provide some temporary keys.\r\n\r\n### Installation and Setup\r\n\r\n1. **First you'll need an API key**\r\n2. **Install Konko AI's Python SDK**\r\n    1. Enable a Python3.8+ environment\r\n    \r\n    `pip install konko`\r\n    \r\n3.  **Set API Keys**\r\n    \r\n          **Option 1:** Set Environment Variables\r\n    \r\n    You can set environment variables for\r\n    \r\n    1. KONKO_API_KEY (Required)\r\n    2. OPENAI_API_KEY (Optional)\r\n    \r\n    In your current shell session, use the export command:\r\n    \r\n    `export KONKO_API_KEY={your_KONKO_API_KEY_here}`\r\n    `export OPENAI_API_KEY={your_OPENAI_API_KEY_here} #Optional`\r\n    \r\n    Alternatively, you can add the above lines directly to your shell startup script (such as .bashrc or .bash_profile for Bash shell and .zshrc for Zsh shell) to have them set automatically every time a new shell session starts.\r\n    \r\n    **Option 2:** Set API Keys Programmatically\r\n    \r\n    If you prefer to set your API keys directly within your Python script or Jupyter notebook, you can use the following commands:\r\n    \r\n    ```python\r\n    konko.set_api_key('your_KONKO_API_KEY_here')\r\n    konko.set_openai_api_key('your_OPENAI_API_KEY_here') # Optional\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n\r\n### Calling a model\r\n\r\nFind a model on the [[Konko Introduction page](https://docs.konko.ai/docs#available-models)](https://docs.konko.ai/docs#available-models)\r\n\r\nFor example, for this [[LLama 2 model](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/meta-llama-2-13b-chat)](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/meta-llama-2-13b-chat). The model id would be: `\"meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\"`\r\n\r\nAnother way to find the list of models running on the Konko instance is through this [[endpoint](https://docs.konko.ai/reference/listmodels)](https://docs.konko.ai/reference/listmodels).\r\n\r\nFrom here, we can initialize our model:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nchat_instance = ChatKonko(max_tokens=10, model = 'meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmsg = HumanMessage(content=\"Hi\")\r\nchat_response = chat_instance([msg])\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

A condition has been added to verify the presence of unlabeled abstracts. Now an abstract will be extracted even if it does not have a subtitle.

This issue arises due to the varying structure of articles; some articles follow a \"subtitle/label: text\" format, while others do not include subtitles in their abstracts.

Some inspiring works like self-query retrievers for VectorStores (for example [Weaviate](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/weaviate_self_query.html) and [others](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/self_query.html)) really turn those vector search databases into a powerful knowledge base! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\r\n\r\nWe are thinking if we can merge all in one, like SQL and vector search and LLMChains, making this SQL vector database memory as the only source of your data. Here are some benefits we can think of for now, maybe you have more \ud83d\udc40:\r\n\r\nWith ALL data you have: since you store all your pasta in the database, you don't need to worry about the foreign keys or links between names from other data source.\r\nFlexible data structure: Even if you have changed your schema, for example added a table, the LLM will know how to JOIN those tables and use those as filters.\r\nSQL compatibility: We found that vector databases that supports SQL in the marketplace have similar interfaces, which means you can change your backend with no pain, just change the name of the distance function in your DB solution and you are ready to go!\r\n\r\n### Issue resolved:\r\n- [Feature Proposal: VectorSearch enabled SQLChain?](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/5122)\r\n\r\n### Change made in this PR:\r\n- An improved schema handling that ignore `types.NullType` columns \r\n- A SQL output Parser interface in `SQLDatabaseChain` to enable Vector SQL capability and further more\r\n- A Retriever based on `SQLDatabaseChain` to retrieve data from the database for RetrievalQAChains and many others\r\n- Allow `SQLDatabaseChain` to retrieve data in python native format\r\n- Includes PR #6737 \r\n- Vector SQL Output Parser for `SQLDatabaseChain` and `SQLDatabaseChainRetriever`\r\n- Prompts that can implement text to VectorSQL\r\n- Corresponding unit-tests and notebook\r\n\r\n### Twitter handle: \r\n- @MyScaleDB\r\n\r\n### Tag Maintainer:\r\nPrompts / General: @hwchase17, @baskaryan\r\nDataLoaders / VectorStores / Retrievers: @rlancemartin, @eyurtsev\r\n\r\n### Dependencies:\r\nNo dependency added",

        "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe feature for pseudonymizing data with ability to retrieve original text (deanonymization) has been implemented. In order to protect private data, such as when querying external APIs (OpenAI), it is worth pseudonymizing sensitive data to maintain full privacy. But then, after the model response, it would be good to have the data in the original form.\r\n\r\nI implemented the `PresidioReversibleAnonymizer`, which consists of two parts:\r\n\r\n1. anonymization - it works the same way as `PresidioAnonymizer`, plus the object itself stores a mapping of made-up values to original ones, for example:\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        \"PERSON\": {\r\n            \"<anonymized>\": \"<original>\",\r\n            \"John Doe\": \"Slim Shady\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"PHONE_NUMBER\": {\r\n            \"111-111-1111\": \"555-555-5555\"\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. deanonymization - using the mapping described above, it matches fake data with original data and then substitutes it.\r\n\r\nBetween anonymization and deanonymization user can perform different operations, for example, passing the output to LLM.\r\n\r\n### Future works\r\n\r\n- **instance anonymization** - at this point, each occurrence of PII is treated as a separate entity and separately anonymized. Therefore, two occurrences of the name John Doe in the text will be changed to two different names. It is therefore worth introducing support for full instance detection, so that repeated occurrences are treated as a single object.\r\n- **better matching and substitution of fake values for real ones** - currently the strategy is based on matching full strings and then substituting them. Due to the indeterminism of language models, it may happen that the value in the answer is slightly changed (e.g. *John Doe* -> *John* or *Main St, New York* -> *New York*) and such a substitution is then no longer possible. Therefore, it is worth adjusting the matching for your needs.\r\n- **Q&A with anonymization** - when I'm done writing all the functionality, I thought it would be a cool resource in documentation to write a notebook about retrieval from documents using anonymization. An iterative process, adding new recognizers to fit the data, lessons learned and what to look out for\r\n\r\n### Twitter handle\r\n@deepsense_ai / @MaksOpp",

This will allow users to use the integration if they have TitanTakeoff deployed externally (not on localhost). This removes the hardcoded reference to localhost \"http://localhost:{port}\".\r\n\r\n### Info about Titan Takeoff\r\nTitan Takeoff is an inference server created by [TitanML](https://www.titanml.co/) that allows you to deploy large language models locally on your hardware in a single command. Most generative model architectures are included, such as Falcon, Llama 2, GPT2, T5 and many more.\r\n\r\nRead more about Titan Takeoff here:\r\n- [Blog](https://medium.com/@TitanML/introducing-titan-takeoff-6c30e55a8e1e)\r\n- [Docs](https://docs.titanml.co/docs/titan-takeoff/getting-started)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nNo new dependencies are introduced. However, users will need to install the titan-iris package in their local environment and start the Titan Takeoff inferencing server in order to use the Titan Takeoff integration.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help and please let me know if you have any questions.\r\ncc: @hwchase17 @baskaryan",

This improvement empowers these classes with greater flexibility and customization when invoking the _get_relevant_document method.\r\n\r\nChanges Made:\r\n\r\nPreviously, the internal _get_relevant_document method within the EnsembleRetriever and MergerRetriever classes did not directly receive keyword arguments. This enhancement addresses this limitation by enabling the propagation of **kwargs directly to the said method. This enables developers to conveniently pass additional arguments and options, extending the capabilities of these retriever classes.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\nEnhanced Flexibility: With this enhancement, users can now pass arbitrary keyword arguments when calling the _get_relevant_document method within the EnsembleRetriever and MergerRetriever classes. This facilitates customizations, configuration adjustments, and integration with other components in a more seamless manner.\r\n\r\n  - Tag maintainer:  @baskaryan \r\n  - Twitter handle: Buckler89\r\n",

        "body": "This PR brings structural updates to `PlaywrightURLLoader`, aiming at making the code more readable and extensible through the abstraction of page evaluation logic. These changes also align this implementation with a similar structure used in LangChain.js. \n\nThe key enhancements include:\n\n1. Introduction of 'PlaywrightEvaluator', an abstract base class for all evaluators. \n2. Creation of 'UnstructuredHtmlEvaluator', a concrete class implementing 'PlaywrightEvaluator', which uses `unstructured` library for processing page's HTML content.\n3. Extension of 'PlaywrightURLLoader' constructor to optionally accept an evaluator of the type 'PlaywrightEvaluator'. It defaults to 'UnstructuredHtmlEvaluator' if no evaluator is provided.\n4. Refactoring of 'load' and 'aload' methods to use the 'evaluate' and 'evaluate_async' methods of the provided 'PageEvaluator' for page content handling.\n\nThis update brings flexibility to 'PlaywrightURLLoader' as it can now utilize different evaluators for page processing depending on the requirement. The abstraction also improves code maintainability and readability.\n\nPlease find the reference for LangChain.js implementation [here](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs/blob/29f3ffdcb34acce1f1db78078f4e7d184eaec6b5/langchain/src/document_loaders/web/playwright.ts#L59).\n\nMaintainers for review: @rlancemartin, @eyurtsev\n\nTwitter: @ywkim\n",

        "body": "Hi, this PR enables configuring the html2text package, instead of being bound to use the hardcoded values. While simply passing `ignore_links` and `ignore_images` to the `transform_documents` method was possible, I preferred passing them to the `__init__` method for 2 reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is more efficient in case of subsequent calls to `transform_documents`.\r\n2. It allows to move the \"complexity\" to the instantiation, keeping the actual execution simple and general enough. IMO the transformers should all follow this pattern, allowing something like this:\r\n```python\r\n# Instantiate transformers\r\ntransformers = [\r\n    TransformerA(foo='bar'),\r\n    TransformerB(bar='foo'),\r\n    # others\r\n]\r\n\r\n# During execution, call them sequentially\r\ndocuments = ...\r\nfor tr in transformers:\r\n    documents = tr.transform_documents(documents)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for the reviews!\r\n\r\n",

In order to protect private data, such as when querying external APIs (OpenAI), it is worth pseudonymizing sensitive data to maintain full privacy.\r\n\r\nAnonynization consists of two steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Identification:** Identify all data fields that contain personally identifiable information (PII).\r\n2. **Replacement**: Replace all PIIs with pseudo values or codes that do not reveal any personal information about the individual but can be used for reference. We're not using regular encryption, because the language model won't be able to understand the meaning or context of the encrypted data.\r\n\r\nWe use *Microsoft Presidio* together with *Faker* framework for anonymization purposes because of the wide range of functionalities they provide. The full implementation is available in `PresidioAnonymizer`.\r\n\r\n### Future works\r\n\r\n- **deanonymization** - add the ability to reverse anonymization. For example, the workflow could look like this: `anonymize -> LLMChain -> deanonymize`. By doing this, we will retain anonymity in requests to, for example, OpenAI, and then be able restore the original data.\r\n- **instance anonymization** - at this point, each occurrence of PII is treated as a separate entity and separately anonymized. Therefore, two occurrences of the name John Doe in the text will be changed to two different names. It is therefore worth introducing support for full instance detection, so that repeated occurrences are treated as a single object.\r\n\r\n### Twitter handle\r\n@deepsense_ai / @MaksOpp",

I can imagine a lot of use cases, when one will need to save a message date, along with some additional metadata. \r\n\r\nTo solve this, I propose to extract the converting logic from BaseMessage to SQLAlchemy model (and vice versa) into a separate class - message converter. So instead of rewriting the whole SQLChatMessageHistory class, a user will only need to write a custom model and a simple mapping class, and pass its instance as a parameter.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that there is no documentation on this class, so I added that too, with an example of custom message converter.\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Tag maintainer\r\n\r\nNot yet\r\n\r\n### Twitter handle\r\n\r\nN/A",

        "body": "I have discovered a bug located within `.github/workflows/_release.yml` which is the primary cause of continuous integration (CI) errors. The problem can be solved; therefore, I have constructed a PR to address the issue.\r\n\r\n## The Issue\r\n\r\nAccess the following link to view the exact errors: [Langhain Release Workflow](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/actions/workflows/langchain_release.yml)\r\n\r\nThe instances of these errors take place for **each PR** that updates `pyproject.toml`, excluding those specifically associated with bumping PRs.\r\n\r\nSee below for the specific error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Error 422: Validation Failed: {\"resource\":\"Release\",\"code\":\"already_exists\",\"field\":\"tag_name\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn image of the error can be viewed here:\r\n![Image](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/assets/13769670/13125f73-9b53-49b7-a83e-653bb01a1da1)\r\n\r\nThe `_release.yml` document contains the following if-condition:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    if: |\r\n        ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged == true }}\r\n        && ${{ contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'release') }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Root Cause\r\n\r\nThe above job constantly runs as the `if-condition` is always identified as `true`.\r\n\r\n## The Logic\r\n\r\nThe `if-condition` can be defined as `if: ${{ b1 }} && ${{ b2 }}`, where `b1` and `b2` are boolean values. However, in terms of condition evaluation with GitHub Actions, `${{ false }}` is identified as a string value, thereby rendering it as truthy as per the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif).\r\n\r\nI have run some tests regarding this behavior within my forked repository. You can consult my [debug PR](https://github.com/zawakin/langchain/pull/1) for reference.\r\n\r\nHere is the result of the tests:\r\n\r\n|If-Condition|Outcome|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|`if: true && ${{ false }}`|Execution|\r\n|`if: ${{ false }}` |Skipped|\r\n|`if: true && false` |Skipped|\r\n|`if: false`|Skipped|\r\n|`if: ${{ true && false }}` |Skipped|\r\n\r\nIn view of the first and second results, we can infer that `${{ false }}` can only be interpreted as `true` for conditions composed of some expressions.\r\nIt is consistent that the condition of `if: ${{ inputs.working-directory == 'libs/langchain' }}` works.\r\n\r\nIt is surprised to be skipped for the second case but it seems the spec of GitHub Actions \ud83d\ude13 \r\n\r\nAnyway, the PR would fix these errors, I believe \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nCould you review this? @hwchase17 or @shoelsch , who is the author of [PR](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/360).",

        "body": "Trusted Publishing is the current best practice for publishing Python packages. Rather than long-lived secret keys, it uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) to allow our GitHub runner to directly authenticate itself to PyPI and get a short-lived publishing token. This locks down publishing quite a bit:\n- There's no long-lived publish key to steal anymore.\n- Publishing is *only* allowed via the *specifically designated* GitHub workflow in the designated repo.\n\nIt also is operationally easier: no keys means there's nothing that needs to be periodically rotated, nothing to worry about leaking, and nobody can accidentally publish a release from their laptop because they happened to have PyPI keys set up.\n\nAfter this gets merged, we'll need to configure PyPI to start expecting trusted publishing. It's only a few clicks and should only take a minute; instructions are here: https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/\n\nMore info:\n- https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-04-20-introducing-trusted-publishers/\n- https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish\n",

It can be used for other use-cases. There is a bug / missing feature(?) in the Redis client breaking the VectorStore implementation. I opened an issue at the client library too (redis/redis-py#2888) to fix this. As soon as this is fixed in `redis-py` library it should be usable there too.\r\n",

Besides that, the default for `api_key` was set to `argilla.apikey`, but since the default values are intended for people using the Argilla Quickstart (easy to run and setup), the defaults should be instead `owner.apikey` if using Argilla 1.11.0 or higher, or `admin.apikey` if using a lower version of Argilla.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we've removed the f-string replacements from the docstrings.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Most generative model architectures are included, such as Falcon, Llama 2, GPT2, T5 and many more.\r\n\r\nRead more about Titan Takeoff here:\r\n- [Blog](https://medium.com/@TitanML/introducing-titan-takeoff-6c30e55a8e1e)\r\n- [Docs](https://docs.titanml.co/docs/titan-takeoff/getting-started)\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nAs Titan Takeoff runs locally on port 8000 by default, no network access is needed. Responses are mocked for testing.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make Lint\r\n- [x] Make Format\r\n- [x] Make Test\r\n\r\n#### Dependencies\r\nNo new dependencies are introduced. However, users will need to install the titan-iris package in their local environment and start the Titan Takeoff inferencing server in order to use the Titan Takeoff integration.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help and please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\ncc: @hwchase17 @baskaryan ",

        "body": "This PR brings structural updates to `PlaywrightURLLoader`, aiming at making the code more readable and extensible through the abstraction of page evaluation logic. These changes also align this implementation with a similar structure used in LangChain.js. \r\n\r\nThe key enhancements include:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction of 'PlaywrightEvaluator', an abstract base class for all evaluators. \r\n2. Creation of 'UnstructuredHtmlEvaluator', a concrete class implementing 'PlaywrightEvaluator', which uses `unstructured` library for processing page's HTML content.\r\n3. Extension of 'PlaywrightURLLoader' constructor to optionally accept an evaluator of the type 'PlaywrightEvaluator'. It defaults to 'UnstructuredHtmlEvaluator' if no evaluator is provided.\r\n4. Refactoring of 'load' and 'aload' methods to use the 'evaluate' and 'evaluate_async' methods of the provided 'PageEvaluator' for page content handling.\r\n\r\nThis update brings flexibility to 'PlaywrightURLLoader' as it can now utilize different evaluators for page processing depending on the requirement. The abstraction also improves code maintainability and readability.\r\n\r\nPlease find the reference for LangChain.js implementation [here](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs/blob/29f3ffdcb34acce1f1db78078f4e7d184eaec6b5/langchain/src/document_loaders/web/playwright.ts#L59).\r\n\r\nMaintainers for review: @rlancemartin, @eyurtsev\r\n\r\nTwitter: @ywkim",

This is helpful because some vector dbs such as Chroma do not support loading list metadata. Currently, if your `Document` has a metadata item that's a list, you get the following when you run `Chroma.from_documents`. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nFile ~/.pyenv/versions/chromadb/lib/python3.10/site-packages/chromadb/api/types.py:140, in validate_metadata(metadata)\r\n    138     # isinstance(True, int) evaluates to True, so we need to check for bools separately\r\n    139     if not isinstance(value, bool) and not isinstance(value, (str, int, float)):\r\n--> 140         raise ValueError(\r\n    141             f\"Expected metadata value to be a str, int, float or bool, got {value} which is a {type(value)}\"\r\n    142         )\r\n    143 return metadata\r\n\r\nValueError: Expected metadata value to be a str, int, float or bool, got [{'text': 'CNN', 'url': '/'}] which is a <class 'list'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe helper function operates on `Document` objects and you can call it like this.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.vectorstore.utils import filter_complex_metadata\r\n\r\nupdated_documents = filter_complex_metadata(documents)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nConfirmed the notebook in [this `unstructured` PR](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pull/1054) runs on the feature branch, where previously it failed.

These conversations can occur between any mix of human or AI participants.\r\n\r\nExamples of some questions you could ask Nebula from a given conversation are:\r\n- What could be the customer\u2019s pain points based on the conversation?\r\n- What sales opportunities can be identified from this conversation?\r\n- What best practices can be derived from this conversation for future customer interactions?\r\n\r\nYou can read more about Nebula here:\r\nhttps://symbl.ai/blog/extract-insights-symbl-ai-generative-ai-recall-ai-meetings/\r\n\r\n#### Integration Test \r\n\r\nAn integration test is added, but it requires network access. Since Nebula is fully managed like OpenAI, network access is required to exercise the integration test.\r\n\r\n#### Linting\r\n\r\n- [x] make lint\r\n- [x] make test (TODO: there seems to be a failure in another non-related test??? Need to check on this.)\r\n- [x] make format\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nNo new dependencies were introduced.\r\n\r\n### Twitter handle\r\n\r\n[@symbldotai](https://twitter.com/symbldotai)\r\n[@dvonthenen](https://twitter.com/dvonthenen)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\r\n\r\ncc: @hwchase17, @baskaryan\r\n",

        "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the `async` `aadd_texts` method for the Pinecone vectorstore. It resolves https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/8635.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nPinecone supports sending upsert requests in parallel, provided the index is initialized with `pool_threads > 1`, as per the example in their [documentation](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/insert-data#sending-upserts-in-parallel).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the `aadd_texts` defined by the `Base` vectorstore using the same parameters as the synchronous version. However, this implementation uses `batch_size` to chunk the embedded documents and unconditionally sets `async_req=True` for every `upsert` request. Additionally, we wrap the `result.get` calls to be called asyncrhonously. Note, once Python3.9+ is the base requirement, [`loop.run_in_executor`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor) should be replaced by [`asyncio.to_thread`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.to_thread).\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n```\r\nomikader@Anh-This-Air langchain % poetry run pytest tests/integration_tests/vectorstores/test_pinecone.py\r\n=========================================================================================== test session starts ============================================================================================\r\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-7.3.2, pluggy-1.0.0\r\nrootdir: /Users/omikader/GitHub/langchain/libs/langchain\r\nconfigfile: pyproject.toml\r\nplugins: asyncio-0.20.3, cov-4.1.0, vcr-1.0.2, mock-3.11.1, syrupy-4.0.2, dotenv-0.5.2, anyio-3.7.0, socket-0.6.0\r\nasyncio: mode=strict\r\ncollected 7 items\r\n\r\ntests/integration_tests/vectorstores/test_pinecone.py .......

Its based loosely on the changes that are in master but with some notable changes:\r\n\r\n## Package name & design improvements\r\nThe import name is now `ElasticsearchStore`, to aid discoverability of the VectorStore.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n## Before\r\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.elastic_vector_search import ElasticVectorSearch, ElasticKnnSearch\r\n\r\n## Now\r\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Retrieval Strategy support\r\nBefore we had a number of classes, depending on the strategy you wanted. `ElasticKnnSearch` for approx, `ElasticVectorSearch` for exact / brute force. \r\n\r\nWith `ElasticsearchStore` we have retrieval strategies:\r\n\r\n### Approx Example\r\nDefault strategy for the vast majority of developers who use Elasticsearch will be inferring the embeddings from outside of Elasticsearch. Uses KNN functionality of _search.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n        texts = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"]\r\n       docsearch = ElasticsearchStore.from_texts(\r\n            texts,\r\n            FakeEmbeddings(),\r\n            es_url=\"http://localhost:9200\",\r\n            index_name=\"sample-index\"\r\n        )\r\n        output = docsearch.similarity_search(\"foo\", k=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Approx, with hybrid\r\nDevelopers who want to search, using both the embedding and the text bm25 match. Its simple to enable.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n texts = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"]\r\n       docsearch = ElasticsearchStore.from_texts(\r\n            texts,\r\n            FakeEmbeddings(),\r\n            es_url=\"http://localhost:9200\",\r\n            index_name=\"sample-index\",\r\n            strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy(hybrid=True)\r\n        )\r\n        output = docsearch.similarity_search(\"foo\", k=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Approx, with `query_model_id`\r\nDevelopers who want to infer within Elasticsearch, using the model loaded in the ml node.\r\n\r\nThis relies on the developer to setup the pipeline and index if they wish to embed the text in Elasticsearch. Example of this in the test.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n texts = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"]\r\n       docsearch = ElasticsearchStore.from_texts(\r\n            texts,\r\n            FakeEmbeddings(),\r\n            es_url=\"http://localhost:9200\",\r\n            index_name=\"sample-index\",\r\n            strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy(\r\n                query_model_id=\"sentence-transformers__all-minilm-l6-v2\"\r\n            ),\r\n        )\r\n        output = docsearch.similarity_search(\"foo\", k=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### I want to provide my own custom Elasticsearch Query\r\nYou might want to have more control over the query, to perform multi-phase retrieval such as LTR, linearly boosting on document parameters like recently updated or geo-distance. You can do this with `custom_query_fn`\r\n\r\n```py\r\n        def my_custom_query(query_body: dict, query: str) -> dict:\r\n            return {\"query\": {\"match\": {\"text\": {\"query\": \"bar\"}}}}\r\n\r\n        texts = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"]\r\n        docsearch = ElasticsearchStore.from_texts(\r\n            texts, FakeEmbeddings(), **elasticsearch_connection, index_name=index_name\r\n        )\r\n        docsearch.similarity_search(\"foo\", k=1, custom_query=my_custom_query)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Exact Example\r\nDevelopers who have a small dataset in Elasticsearch, dont want the cost of indexing the dims vs tradeoff on cost at query time. Uses script_score.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n        texts = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"]\r\n       docsearch = ElasticsearchStore.from_texts(\r\n            texts,\r\n            FakeEmbeddings(),\r\n            es_url=\"http://localhost:9200\",\r\n            index_name=\"sample-index\",\r\n            strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ExactRetrievalStrategy(),\r\n        )\r\n        output = docsearch.similarity_search(\"foo\", k=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ELSER Example\r\nElastic provides its own sparse vector model called ELSER. With these changes, its really easy to use. The vector store creates a pipeline and index thats setup for ELSER. All the developer needs to do is configure, ingest and query via langchain tooling.\r\n\r\n```py\r\ntexts = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"]\r\n       docsearch = ElasticsearchStore.from_texts(\r\n            texts,\r\n            FakeEmbeddings(),\r\n            es_url=\"http://localhost:9200\",\r\n            index_name=\"sample-index\",\r\n            strategy=ElasticsearchStore.SparseVectorStrategy(),\r\n        )\r\n        output = docsearch.similarity_search(\"foo\", k=1)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\nIn future, we can introduce new strategies and allow us to not break bwc as we evolve the index / query strategy. \r\n\r\n## Credit\r\nOn release, could you credit @elastic and @phoey1 please? Thank you! \r\n",

        "body": "This pull request aims to ensure that the `OpenAICallbackHandler` can properly calculate the total cost for Azure OpenAI chat models. The following changes have resolved this issue:\r\n\r\n- The `model_name` has been added to the ChatResult llm_output. Without this, the default values of `gpt-35-turbo` were applied. This was causing the total cost for Azure OpenAI's GPT-4 to be significantly inaccurate.\r\n- A new parameter `model_version` has been added to `AzureChatOpenAI`. Azure does not include the model version in the response. With the addition of `model_name`, this is not a significant issue for GPT-4 models, but it's an issue for GPT-3.5-Turbo. Version 0301 (default) of GPT-3.5-Turbo on Azure has a flat rate of 0.002 per 1k tokens for both prompt and completion. However, version 0613 introduced a split in pricing for prompt and completion tokens.\r\n- The `OpenAICallbackHandler` implementation has been updated with the proper model names, versions, and cost per 1k tokens.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added to ensure the functionality works as expected; the Azure ChatOpenAI notebook has been updated with examples.\r\n\r\nMaintainers: @hwchase17, @baskaryan\r\n\r\nTwitter handle: @jjczopek",

        "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nThe previous Redis implementation did not allow for the user to specify the index configuration (i.e. changing the underlying algorithm) or add additional metadata to use for querying (i.e. hybrid or \"filtered\" search).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the ability to specify custom index attributes and metadata attributes as well as use that metadata in filtered queries. Overall, more structure was introduced to the Redis implementation that should allow for easier maintainability moving forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example data\r\n\r\nSuppose we have the following sample data\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nmetadata = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"user\": \"john\",\r\n        \"age\": 18,\r\n        \"job\": \"engineer\",\r\n        \"credit_score\": \"high\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"user\": \"derrick\",\r\n        \"age\": 14,\r\n        \"job\": \"doctor\",\r\n        \"credit_score\": \"low\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"user\": \"nancy\",\r\n        \"age\": 94,\r\n        \"job\": \"doctor\",\r\n        \"credit_score\": \"high\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"user\": \"tyler\",\r\n        \"age\": 100,\r\n        \"job\": \"engineer\",\r\n        \"credit_score\": \"high\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"user\": \"tim\",\r\n        \"age\": 12,\r\n        \"job\": \"dermatologist\",\r\n        \"credit_score\": \"high\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"user\": \"taimur\",\r\n        \"age\": 15,\r\n        \"job\": \"CEO\",\r\n        \"credit_score\": \"low\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"user\": \"joe\",\r\n        \"age\": 35,\r\n        \"job\": \"dentist\",\r\n        \"credit_score\": \"medium\",\r\n    },\r\n]\r\n\r\ntexts = [\"foo\", \"foo\", \"foo\", \"foo\", \"bar\", \"bar\", \"bar\"]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n\r\nThe following features are now available with the Redis integration into Langchain\r\n\r\n## Index schema generation\r\n\r\nThe schema for the index will now be automatically generated if not specified by the user. For example, the data above has the multiple metadata categories. The the following example\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nfrom langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\r\nfrom langchain.vectorstores.redis import Redis\r\n\r\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\r\n\r\n\r\nrds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys(\r\n    texts,\r\n    embeddings,\r\n    metadatas=metadata,\r\n    redis_url=\"redis://localhost:6379\",\r\n    index_name=\"users\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoading the data in through this and the other ``from_documents`` and ``from_texts`` methods will now generate index schema in Redis like the following.\r\n\r\nview index schema with the ``redisvl`` tool. [link](redisvl.com)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ rvl index info -i users\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex Information:\r\n| Index Name   | Storage Type   | Prefixes      | Index Options   |   Indexing |\r\n|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|\r\n| users        | HASH           | ['doc:users'] | []              |          0 |\r\nIndex Fields:\r\n| Name           | Attribute      | Type    | Field Option   |   Option Value |\r\n|----------------|----------------|---------|----------------|----------------|\r\n| user           | user           | TEXT    | WEIGHT         |              1 |\r\n| job            | job            | TEXT    | WEIGHT         |              1 |\r\n| credit_score   | credit_score   | TEXT    | WEIGHT         |              1 |\r\n| content        | content        | TEXT    | WEIGHT         |              1 |\r\n| age            | age            | NUMERIC |                |                |\r\n| content_vector | content_vector | VECTOR  |                |                |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Custom Metadata specification\r\n\r\nThe metadata schema generation has the following rules\r\n1. All text fields are indexed as text fields.\r\n2. All numeric fields are index as numeric fields.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to have a text field as a tag field, users can specify overrides like the following for the example data\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# this can also be a path to a yaml file\r\nindex_schema = {\r\n    \"text\": [{\"name\": \"user\"}, {\"name\": \"job\"}],\r\n    \"tag\": [{\"name\": \"credit_score\"}],\r\n    \"numeric\": [{\"name\": \"age\"}],\r\n}\r\n\r\nrds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys(\r\n    texts,\r\n    embeddings,\r\n    metadatas=metadata,\r\n    redis_url=\"redis://localhost:6379\",\r\n    index_name=\"users\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis will change the index specification to \r\n\r\nIndex Information:\r\n| Index Name   | Storage Type   | Prefixes       | Index Options   |   Indexing |\r\n|--------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|\r\n| users2       | HASH           | ['doc:users2'] | []              |          0 |\r\nIndex Fields:\r\n| Name           | Attribute      | Type    | Field Option   | Option Value   |\r\n|----------------|----------------|---------|----------------|----------------|\r\n| user           | user           | TEXT    | WEIGHT         | 1              |\r\n| job            | job            | TEXT    | WEIGHT         | 1              |\r\n| content        | content        | TEXT    | WEIGHT         | 1              |\r\n| credit_score   | credit_score   | TAG     | SEPARATOR      | ,              |\r\n| age            | age            | NUMERIC |                |                |\r\n| content_vector | content_vector | VECTOR  |                |                |\r\n\r\n\r\nand throw a warning to the user (log output) that the generated schema does not match the specified schema.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nindex_schema does not match generated schema from metadata.\r\nindex_schema: {'text': [{'name': 'user'}, {'name': 'job'}], 'tag': [{'name': 'credit_score'}], 'numeric': [{'name': 'age'}]}\r\ngenerated_schema: {'text': [{'name': 'user'}, {'name': 'job'}, {'name': 'credit_score'}], 'numeric': [{'name': 'age'}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs long as this is on purpose,  this is fine.\r\n\r\nThe schema can be defined as a yaml file or a dictionary\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n\r\ntext:\r\n  - name: user\r\n  - name: job\r\ntag:\r\n  - name: credit_score\r\nnumeric:\r\n  - name: age\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you pass in a path like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nrds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys(\r\n    texts,\r\n    embeddings,\r\n    metadatas=metadata,\r\n    redis_url=\"redis://localhost:6379\",\r\n    index_name=\"users3\",\r\n    index_schema=Path(\"sample1.yml\").resolve()\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will create the same schema as defined in the dictionary example\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex Information:\r\n| Index Name   | Storage Type   | Prefixes       | Index Options   |   Indexing |\r\n|--------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|\r\n| users3       | HASH           | ['doc:users3'] | []              |          0 |\r\nIndex Fields:\r\n| Name           | Attribute      | Type    | Field Option   | Option Value   |\r\n|----------------|----------------|---------|----------------|----------------|\r\n| user           | user           | TEXT    | WEIGHT         | 1              |\r\n| job            | job            | TEXT    | WEIGHT         | 1              |\r\n| content        | content        | TEXT    | WEIGHT         | 1              |\r\n| credit_score   | credit_score   | TAG     | SEPARATOR      | ,              |\r\n| age            | age            | NUMERIC |                |                |\r\n| content_vector | content_vector | VECTOR  |                |                |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Custom Vector Indexing Schema\r\n\r\nUsers with large use cases may want to change how they formulate the vector index created by Langchain\r\n\r\nTo utilize all the features of Redis for vector database use cases like this, you can now do the following to pass in index attribute modifiers like changing the indexing algorithm to HNSW.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nvector_schema = {\r\n    \"algorithm\": \"HNSW\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nrds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys(\r\n    texts,\r\n    embeddings,\r\n    metadatas=metadata,\r\n    redis_url=\"redis://localhost:6379\",\r\n    index_name=\"users3\",\r\n    vector_schema=vector_schema\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more complex example may look like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nvector_schema = {\r\n    \"algorithm\": \"HNSW\",\r\n    \"ef_construction\": 200,\r\n    \"ef_runtime\": 20\r\n}\r\n\r\nrds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys(\r\n    texts,\r\n    embeddings,\r\n    metadatas=metadata,\r\n    redis_url=\"redis://localhost:6379\",\r\n    index_name=\"users3\",\r\n    vector_schema=vector_schema\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll names correspond to the arguments you would set if using Redis-py or RedisVL. (put in doc link later)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Better Querying\r\n\r\nBoth vector queries and Range (limit) queries are now available and metadata is returned by default. The outputs are shown.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> query = \"foo\"\r\n>>> results = rds.similarity_search(query, k=1)\r\n>>> print(results)\r\n[Document(page_content='foo', metadata={'user': 'derrick', 'job': 'doctor', 'credit_score': 'low', 'age': '14', 'id': 'doc:users:657a47d7db8b447e88598b83da879b9d', 'score': '7.15255737305e-07'})]\r\n\r\n>>> results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=1, return_metadata=False)\r\n>>> print(results) # no metadata, but with scores\r\n[(Document(page_content='foo', metadata={}), 7.15255737305e-07)]\r\n\r\n>>> results = rds.similarity_search_limit_score(query, k=6, score_threshold=0.0001)\r\n>>> print(len(results)) # range query (only above threshold even if k is higher)\r\n4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Custom metadata filtering\r\n\r\nA big advantage of Redis in this space is being able to do filtering on data stored alongside the vector itself. With the example above, the following is now possible in langchain. The equivalence operators are overridden to describe a new expression language that mimic that of [redisvl](redisvl.com). This allows for arbitrarily long sequences of filters that resemble SQL commands that can be used directly with vector queries and range queries.\r\n\r\nThere are two interfaces by which to do so and both are shown. \r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n>>> from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisFilter, RedisNum, RedisText\r\n\r\n>>> age_filter = RedisFilter.num(\"age\") > 18\r\n>>> age_filter = RedisNum(\"age\") > 18 # equivalent\r\n>>> results = rds.similarity_search(query, filter=age_filter)\r\n>>> print(len(results))\r\n3\r\n\r\n>>> job_filter = RedisFilter.text(\"job\") == \"engineer\" \r\n>>> job_filter = RedisText(\"job\") == \"engineer\" # equivalent\r\n>>> results = rds.similarity_search(query, filter=job_filter)\r\n>>> print(len(results))\r\n2\r\n\r\n# fuzzy match text search\r\n>>> job_filter = RedisFilter.text(\"job\") % \"eng*\"\r\n>>> results = rds.similarity_search(query, filter=job_filter)\r\n>>> print(len(results))\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\n# combined filters (AND)\r\n>>> combined = age_filter & job_filter\r\n>>> results = rds.similarity_search(query, filter=combined)\r\n>>> print(len(results))\r\n1\r\n\r\n# combined filters (OR)\r\n>>> combined = age_filter | job_filter\r\n>>> results = rds.similarity_search(query, filter=combined)\r\n>>> print(len(results))\r\n4\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the above filter results can be checked against the data above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] more tests\r\n- [x] docstrings\r\n- [x] docs\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n  - Issue: #3967 \r\n  - Dependencies: No added dependencies\r\n  - Tag maintainer: @hwchase17 @baskaryan @rlancemartin \r\n  - Twitter handle: @sampartee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

All the callback outputs are then logged to the run object.\r\n* The output of each callback action (e.g., `on_llm_start`) is saved to S3 bucket as json file.\r\n* Optionally, you can also log additional information such as the LLM hyper-parameters to the same run object.\r\n* Once the callback object is no more needed, you will need to call the `flush_tracker()` method. This makes sure that any intermediate files are deleted.\r\n* A separate notebook example is provided to show how the callback is used.\r\n\r\nThank you [Mohamad Al Jazaery](https://github.com/mohjaz), [Shinan Zhang](https://github.com/sz640) for your contribution and review!\r\n\r\n@3coins  @agola11 ",

This increases the maintenance effort a bit, but I think it's worth it to make sure people can get started quickly with these important connectors. This is also why I linked the spec and the documentation page in the readme as these two contain all the information to configure a source correctly (e.g. it won't suggest using oauth if that's avoidable even if the connector supports it).\r\n\r\n## Document generation\r\nThe \"documents\" produced by these loaders won't have a text part (instead, all the record fields are put into the metadata). If a text is required by the use case, the caller needs to do custom transformation suitable for their use case.\r\n\r\n## Incremental sync\r\nAll loaders support incremental syncs if the underlying streams support it.

Ensure the required package \"esdk-obs-python\" is installed.\r\n2. Configure the endpoint, access key, secret key, and bucket details for Huawei OBS in the Langchain settings.\r\n3. Load documents from Huawei OBS using the updated document loader module.\r\n4. Verify that documents are successfully retrieved and loaded into Langchain for further processing.\r\n\r\nPlease review this PR and let us know if any further improvements are needed.

Additionally, the dropbox Python package is required.\r\n\r\nThe `DropboxLoader` class is designed to be used as a document loader for processing various file types, including text files, PDFs, and Dropbox Paper files.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n`pip install dropbox` and `pip install unstructured` for PDF reading.\r\n\r\n## Tag maintainer\r\n@rlancemartin, @eyurtsev (from Data Loaders).

Added imports for the `json` and `time` modules.\r\n2. Added new constructor parameters: `load_dimension_values`, `dimension_values_limit`, `dimension_values_max_retries`, and `dimension_values_retry_delay`.\r\n3. Updated the class documentation with descriptions for the new constructor parameters.\r\n4. Added a new private method `_get_dimension_values()` to retrieve dimension values from Cube's REST API.\r\n5. Modified the `load()` method to load dimension values for string dimensions if `load_dimension_values` is set to `True`.\r\n6. Updated the API endpoint in the `load()` method from the base URL to the metadata endpoint.\r\n7. Refactored the code to retrieve metadata from the response JSON.\r\n8. Added the `column_member_type` field to the metadata dictionary to indicate if a column is a measure or a dimension.\r\n9. Added the `column_values` field to the metadata dictionary to store the dimension values retrieved from Cube's API.\r\n10. Modified the `page_content` construction to include the column title and description instead of the table name, column name, data type, title, and description.\r\n\r\nThese changes improve the functionality and flexibility of the `CubeSemanticLoader` class by allowing the loading of dimension values and providing more detailed metadata for each document.\r\n",

        "body": "- [Xorbits Inference(Xinference)](https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference) is a powerful and versatile library designed to serve language, speech recognition, and multimodal models. Xinference supports a variety of GGML-compatible models including chatglm, whisper, and vicuna, and utilizes heterogeneous hardware and a distributed architecture for seamless cross-device and cross-server model deployment.\r\n- This PR integrates Xinference models and Xinference embeddings into LangChain.\r\n- Dependencies: To install the depenedencies for this integration, run\r\n    \r\n    `pip install \"xinference[all]\"`\r\n    \r\n- Example Usage:\r\n\r\nTo start a local instance of Xinference, run `xinference`.\r\n\r\nTo deploy Xinference in a distributed cluster, first start an Xinference supervisor using `xinference-supervisor`:\r\n\r\n`xinference-supervisor -H \"${supervisor_host}\"`\r\n\r\nThen, start the Xinference workers using `xinference-worker` on each server you want to run them on. \r\n\r\n`xinference-worker -e \"http://${supervisor_host}:9997\"`\r\n\r\nTo use Xinference with LangChain, you also need to launch a model. You can use command line interface (CLI) to do so. Fo example: `xinference launch -n vicuna-v1.3 -f ggmlv3 -q q4_0`. This launches a model named vicuna-v1.3 with `model_format=\"ggmlv3\"` and `quantization=\"q4_0\"`. A model UID is returned for you to use. \r\n\r\nNow you can use Xinference with LangChain:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.llms import Xinference\r\n\r\nllm = Xinference(\r\n    server_url=\"http://0.0.0.0:9997\", # suppose the supervisor_host is \"0.0.0.0\"\r\n    model_uid = {model_uid} # model UID returned from launching a model\r\n)\r\n\r\nllm(\r\n    prompt=\"Q: where can we visit in the capital of France? A:\",\r\n    generate_config={\"max_tokens\": 1024},\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use RESTful client to launch a model:\r\n```python\r\nfrom xinference.client import RESTfulClient\r\n\r\nclient = RESTfulClient(\"http://0.0.0.0:9997\")\r\n\r\nmodel_uid = client.launch_model(model_name=\"vicuna-v1.3\", model_size_in_billions=7, quantization=\"q4_0\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following code block demonstrates how to use Xinference embeddings with LangChain:\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.embeddings import XinferenceEmbeddings\r\n\r\nxinference = XinferenceEmbeddings(\r\n    server_url=\"http://0.0.0.0:9997\",\r\n    model_uid = model_uid\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nquery_result = xinference.embed_query(\"This is a test query\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndoc_result = xinference.embed_documents([\"text A\", \"text B\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nXinference is still under rapid development. Feel free to [join our Slack community](https://xorbitsio.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1z3zsm9ep-87yI9YZ_B79HLB2ccTq4WA) to get the latest updates! \r\n\r\n- Request for review:\u00a0@hwchase17, @baskaryan\r\n- Twitter handle:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Xorbitsio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Optimizing important numerical code and making it run faster.\r\n\r\nPerformance went up by 1.48x (148%). Runtime went down from 138715us to 56020us\r\n\r\nOptimization explanation:\r\n\r\nThe `cosine_similarity_top_k` function is where we made the most significant optimizations. \r\nInstead of sorting the entire score_array which needs considering all elements, `np.argpartition` is utilized to find the top_k largest scores indices, this operation has a time complexity of O(n), higher performance than sorting. Remember, `np.argpartition` doesn't guarantee the order of the values. So we need to use argsort() to get the indices that would sort our top-k values after partitioning, which is much more efficient because it only sorts the top-K elements, not the entire array. Then to get the row and column indices of sorted top_k scores in the original score array, we use `np.unravel_index`. This operation is more efficient and cleaner than a list comprehension. \r\n\r\nThe code has been tested for correctness by running the following snippet on both the original function and the optimized function and averaged over 5 times.\r\n```\r\ndef test_cosine_similarity_top_k_large_matrices():\r\n    X = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)\r\n    Y = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)\r\n    top_k = 100\r\n    score_threshold = 0.5\r\n    gc.disable()\r\n    counter = time.perf_counter_ns()\r\n    return_value = cosine_similarity_top_k(X, Y, top_k, score_threshold)\r\n    duration = time.perf_counter_ns() - counter\r\n    gc.enable()\r\n```\r\n\r\n@hwaking @hwchase17 @jerwelborn \r\n\r\nUnit tests pass, I also generated more regression tests which all passed.",

Updated the default prompt for SQL Query Checker: The current prompt does not clearly specify the final response that the LLM (Language Model) should provide when checking for the query if `use_query_checker` is enabled in SQLDatabase Chain. As a result, the LLM adds extra words like \"Here is your updated query\" to the response. However, this causes a syntax error when executing the SQL command in SQLDatabaseChain, as these additional words are also included in the SQL query. \r\n\r\n2. Moved the query's execution part into a separate method for  SQLDatabase: The purpose of this change is to provide users with more flexibility when obtaining the result of an SQL query in the original form returned by sqlalchemy. In the previous implementation, the run method returned the results as a string. By creating a distinct method for execution, users can now receive the results in original format, which proves helpful in various scenarios. For example, during the development of a tool, I found it advantageous to obtain results in original format rather than a string, as currently done by the run method.\r\n\r\n- Tag maintainer: @hinthornw",

The original test was failing for me due to the model argument not being specified... perhaps this test is not regularly run? I fixed it by adding a call to the lightweight hello world model which should not be burdensome for replicate infra.\r\n2. I couldn't get the `make integration_tests` command to pass... a lot of failures in other integration tests due to missing dependencies... however I did make sure the particluar test file I updated does pass, by running `poetry run pytest tests/integration_tests/llms/test_replicate.py`\r\n\r\nFinally, I am @tjaffri https://twitter.com/tjaffri for feature announcement tweets... or if you could please tag @docugami https://twitter.com/docugami we would really appreciate that :-)\r\n\r\nTagging model maintainers @hwchase17  @baskaryan \r\n\r\nThank for all the awesome work you folks are doing.",

The current [ElasticSearchBM25Retriever](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/c58d35765daa063b87733e006a4d65e2e1f388d3/langchain/retrievers/elastic_search_bm25.py) is limited to ElasticSearch, but this new retriever can be used with more flexibility. The BM25 implementation used in this retriever is based on [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/3ae286ee7970ab5ffebfcb2ea383e1bf4b5f0b8b/gensim/models/bm25model.py), which is widely used in many applications. With this new retriever, users can now utilize BM25 retrieval without being tied to a specific backend.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n[Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim)\r\n\r\n@rlancemartin, @eyurtsev\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "** This should land Monday the 17th ** \r\n\r\nChroma is upgrading from `0.3.29` to `0.4.0`. `0.4.0` is easier to build, more durable, faster, smaller, and more extensible. This comes with a few changes:\r\n\r\n1. A simplified and improved client setup. Instead of having to remember weird settings, users can just do `EphemeralClient`, `PersistentClient` or `HttpClient` (the underlying direct `Client` implementation is also still accessible)\r\n\r\n2. We migrated data stores away from `duckdb` and `clickhouse`. This changes the api for the `PersistentClient` that used to reference `chroma_db_impl=\"duckdb+parquet\"`. Now we simply set `is_persistent=true`. `is_persistent` is set for you to `true` if you use `PersistentClient`. \r\n\r\n3. Because we migrated away from `duckdb` and `clickhouse` - this also means that users need to migrate their data into the new layout and schema. Chroma is committed to providing extension notification and tooling around any schema and data migrations (for example - this PR!). \r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to `0.4.0` - if users try to access their data that was stored in the previous regime, the system will throw an `Exception` and instruct them how to use the migration assistant to migrate their data. The migration assitant is a pip installable CLI: `pip install chroma_migrate`. And is runnable by calling `chroma_migrate` \r\n\r\n-- TODO ADD here is a short video demonstrating how it works. \r\n\r\nPlease reference the readme at [chroma-core/chroma-migrate](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma-migrate) to see a full write-up of our philosophy on migrations as well as more details about this particular migration. \r\n\r\nPlease direct any users facing issues upgrading to our Discord channel called [#get-help](https://discord.com/channels/1073293645303795742/1129200523111841883). We have also created a [email listserv](https://airtable.com/shrHaErIs1j9F97BE) to notify developers directly in the future about breaking changes. \r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- [x] Migrated any `duckdb+parquet` strings to the new format\r\n- [ ] Notified users about the breaking change (this PR, other suggestions?)\r\n- [x] Move pypi target away from feature-branch and to `0.4.0` after `0.4.0` is released. \r\n- [x] We need to merge in a more flexible range for `fastapi` to the chroma branch - as is in-progress here https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/pull/807",

Added imports for the `json` and `time` modules.\r\n2. Added new constructor parameters: `load_dimension_values`, `dimension_values_limit`, `dimension_values_max_retries`, and `dimension_values_retry_delay`.\r\n3. Updated the class documentation with descriptions for the new constructor parameters.\r\n4. Added a new private method `_get_dimension_values()` to retrieve dimension values from Cube's REST API.\r\n5. Modified the `load()` method to load dimension values for string dimensions if `load_dimension_values` is set to `True`.\r\n6. Updated the API endpoint in the `load()` method from the base URL to the metadata endpoint.\r\n7. Refactored the code to retrieve metadata from the response JSON.\r\n8. Added the `column_member_type` field to the metadata dictionary to indicate if a column is a measure or a dimension.\r\n9. Added the `column_values` field to the metadata dictionary to store the dimension values retrieved from Cube's API.\r\n10. Modified the `page_content` construction to include the column title and description instead of the table name, column name, data type, title, and description.\r\n\r\nThese changes improve the functionality and flexibility of the `CubeSemanticLoader` class by allowing the loading of dimension values and providing more detailed metadata for each document.\r\n\r\n\r\n@rlancemartin, @eyurtsev\r\n",

If provided the existing memory will be loaded instead of regenerating a summary from the loaded messages.\r\n \r\nWhy? If we have past messages to load from, it is likely we also have an existing summary. This is particularly helpful in cases where the chat is ephemeral and/or is backed by serverless where the chat history is not stored but where the updated chat history is passed back and forth between a backend/frontend. \r\n\r\nEg: Take a stateless qa backend implementation that loads messages on every request and generates a response \u2014 without this addition, each time the messages are loaded via from_messages, the summaries are recomputed even though they may have just been computed during the previous response. With this, the previously computed summary can be passed in and avoid:\r\n  1) spending extra $$$ on tokens, and \r\n  2) increased response time by avoiding regenerating previously generated summary.\r\n\r\nTag maintainer: @hwchase17\r\nTwitter handle: https://twitter.com/ShantanuNair\r\n\r\n",

The relevance respect the original search score but accommodates the lest relevant document in the middle of the context.\r\nExtract from the paper (one image speaks 1000 tokens):\r\n![image](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/assets/1821407/fafe4843-6e18-4fa6-9416-50cc1d32e811)\r\nThis seems to be common to all diff arquitectures. SO I think we need a good generic way to implement this reordering and run some test in our already running retrievers.\r\nIt could be that my approach is not the best one from the architecture point of view, happy to have a discussion about that.\r\nFor me this was the best place to introduce the change and start retesting diff implementations.\r\n\r\n@rlancemartin, @eyurtsev",

Some inspiring works like self-query retrievers for VectorStores (for example [Weaviate](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/weaviate_self_query.html) and [others](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/self_query.html)) really turn those vector search databases into a powerful knowledge base! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\r\n\r\nWe are thinking if we can merge all in one, like SQL and vector search and LLMChains, making this SQL vector database memory as the only source of your data. Here are some benefits we can think of for now, maybe you have more \ud83d\udc40:\r\n\r\nWith ALL data you have: since you store all your pasta in the database, you don't need to worry about the foreign keys or links between names from other data source.\r\nFlexible data structure: Even if you have changed your schema, for example added a table, the LLM will know how to JOIN those tables and use those as filters.\r\nSQL compatibility: We found that vector databases that supports SQL in the marketplace have similar interfaces, which means you can change your backend with no pain, just change the name of the distance function in your DB solution and you are ready to go!\r\n\r\n### Issue resolved:\r\n- [Feature Proposal: VectorSearch enabled SQLChain?](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/5122)\r\n\r\n### Change made in this PR:\r\n- An improved schema handling that ignore `types.NullType` columns \r\n- A SQL output Parser interface in `SQLDatabaseChain` to enable Vector SQL capability and further more\r\n- A Retriever based on `SQLDatabaseChain` to retrieve data from the database for RetrievalQAChains and many others\r\n- Allow `SQLDatabaseChain` to retrieve data in python native format\r\n- Includes PR #6737 \r\n- Vector SQL Output Parser for `SQLDatabaseChain` and `SQLDatabaseChainRetriever`\r\n- Prompts that can implement text to VectorSQL\r\n- Corresponding unit-tests and notebook\r\n\r\n### Twitter handle: \r\n- @MyScaleDB\r\n\r\n### Tag Maintainer:\r\nPrompts / General: @hwchase17, @baskaryan\r\nDataLoaders / VectorStores / Retrievers: @rlancemartin, @eyurtsev\r\n\r\n### Dependencies:\r\nNo dependency added",

Using this is at least an order of magnitude faster than using `en_core_web_sm` according to my local tests.\r\nAlso, spacy sentence tokenization based on `en_core_web_sm` can be sped up in this case by not doing the NER stage. This shaves some cycles too, both when loading the model and when parsing the text.\r\n\r\nConsequently, this PR adds the option to use the basic spacy sentencizer, and it disables the NER stage for the current approach, *which is kept as the default*.\r\n\r\nLastly, when extracting the tokenized sentences, the `text` attribute is called directly instead of doing the string conversion, which is IMO a bit more idiomatic.\r\n\r\n@baskaryan",

You can also give in your own filters.\r\n\r\nI realize this might seem a bit abstract without a practical demonstration, so if you think it would be helpful, I'd be more than happy to whip up a Jupyter notebook. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to let me know your thoughts on this, and if there's anything specific you'd like me to cover in the notebook if we decide to go that route.\r\n\r\nThank you for the great work. \r\n\r\n  - Tag maintainer: @rlancemartin @eyurtsev\r\n  - Twitter handle: @ET_TheDev\r\n",

        "body": "**Description: a description of the change**\r\n\r\nFixed `make docs_build` and related scripts which caused errors. There are several changes.\r\n\r\nFirst, I made the build of the documentation and the API Reference into two separate commands. This is because it takes less time to build. The commands for documents are `make docs_build`, `make docs_clean`, and `make docs_linkcheck`. The commands for API Reference are `make api_docs_build`, `api_docs_clean`, and `api_docs_linkcheck`.\r\n\r\nIt looked like `docs/.local_build.sh` could be used to build the documentation, so I used that. Since `.local_build.sh` was also building API Rerefence internally, I removed that process. `.local_build.sh` also added some Bash options to stop in error or so. Futher more added `cd \"${SCRIPT_DIR}\"` at the beginning so that the script will work no matter which directory it is executed in.\r\n\r\n`docs/api_reference/api_reference.rst` is removed,  because which is generated by `docs/api_reference/create_api_rst.py`, and added it to .gitignore.\r\n\r\nFinally, the description of CONTRIBUTING.md was modified.\r\n\r\n**Issue: the issue # it fixes (if applicable)**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/6413\r\n\r\n**Dependencies: any dependencies required for this change**\r\n\r\n`nbdoc` was missing in group docs so it was added. I installed it with the `poetry add --group docs nbdoc` command. I am concerned if any modifications are needed to poetry.lock. I would greatly appreciate it if you could pay close attention to this file during the review.\r\n\r\n**Tag maintainer**\r\n- General / Misc / if you don't know who to tag: @baskaryan\r\n\r\nIf this PR needs any additional changes, I'll be happy to make them!\r\n",

The 'verbose' parameter, when set to True, will enable the output of detailed logs during the execution of the Llama model. This added parameter can aid in debugging and understanding the internal processes of the module.\r\n\r\nThe verbose parameter is a boolean that prints verbose output to stderr when set to True. By default, the verbose parameter is set to True but can be toggled off if less output is desired. This new parameter has been added to the `validate_environment` method of the `LlamaCpp` class which initializes the `llama_cpp.Llama` API:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass LlamaCpp(LLM):\r\n    ...\r\n    @root_validator()\r\n    def validate_environment(cls, values: Dict) -> Dict:\r\n        ...\r\n        model_param_names = [\r\n            ...\r\n            \"verbose\",  # New verbose parameter added\r\n        ]\r\n        ...\r\n        values[\"client\"] = Llama(model_path, **model_params)\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Issue:** \r\nNot applicable (If there is an issue that this PR resolves, please link to it here)\r\n\r\n**Dependencies:** \r\nNo new dependencies introduced.\r\n\r\n**Maintainer:** \r\nTagging @hinthornw, as this change relates to Tools / Toolkits.\r\n\r\n**Twitter handle:** \r\n(If you want a shout-out on Twitter and have a Twitter handle, mention it here.)\r\n\r\nThis change does not introduce any new features or integrations, so no new tests or notebooks are provided.

It does this by altering the template-formatting system to use a subclass of `str` rather than just a `str`. This is the most pythonic way I could find to accomplish this (There is also UserString, but that doesn't subclass `str` so it fails `isinstance` checks)\r\n\r\nWhat this specifically allows is that libraries that monitor API libraries like the OpenAI SDK, can look at the prompt that the API was called with (a completion text or a messages array) and inspect the objects to pull out the template (on `.template`) or the template arguments (on `.template_args`)\r\n\r\n(I spent some time trying to do this with callbacks, but the problem I ran into is that you have access to the prompt + variables in `on_chain_start` but there isn't an easy way to tie this back to the actual request sent to the OpenAI and this data doesn't seem to be captured by `on_llm_start`, and these are called in a way that makes it hard to capture any data and have it visible from the openai `create()` methods)\r\n\r\nIf this approach feels right, I can go ahead and write some unit tests for it as a part of this PR.\r\n\r\nNot sure who to tag for this, so tagging @baskaryan and @hwchase17 ",

Allow customization of database connection behavior by exposing engine_args parameter in interfaces.**\r\n        - This commit adds the `engine_args` parameter to the interfaces, allowing users to customize the behavior of the database connection. The `engine_args` parameter accepts a dictionary of additional arguments that will be passed to the create_engine function. Users can now modify various aspects of the database connection, such as connection pool size and recycle time. This enhancement provides more flexibility and control to users when interacting with the database through the exposed interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis commit is related to VectorStores @rlancemartin @eyurtsev \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention and consideration.\r\n",

        "body": "Current problems:\r\n1. Evaluating LLMs or Chat models isn't smooth. Even specifying 'generations' as the output inserts a redundant list into the eval template\r\n2. Configuring input / prediction / reference keys in the `get_qa_evaluator` function is confusing. Unless you are using a chain with the default keys, you have to specify all the variables and need to reason about whether the key corresponds to the traced run's inputs, outputs or the examples inputs or outputs.\r\n\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n- Configure the run evaluator according to a model. Use the model type and input/output keys to assert compatibility where possible. Only need to specify a reference_key for certain evaluators (which is less confusing than specifying input keys)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen does this work:\r\n- If you have your langchain model available (assumed always for run_on_dataset flow)\r\n- If you are evaluating an LLM, Chat model, or chain\r\n- If the LLM or chat models are traced by langchain (wouldn't work if you add an incompatible schema via the REST API)\r\n\r\nWhen would this fail:\r\n- Currently if you directly create an example from an LLM run, the outputs are generations with all the extra metadata present. A simple `example_key` and dumping all to the template could make the evaluations unreliable\r\n- Doesn't help if you're not using the low level API\r\n- If you want to instantiate the evaluator without instantiating your chain or LLM (maybe common for monitoring, for instance) -> could also load from run or run type though\r\n\r\nWhat's ugly:\r\n- Personally think it's better to load evaluators one by one since passing a config down is pretty confusing.\r\n- Lots of testing needs to be added\r\n- Inconsistent in that it makes a separate run and example input mapper instead of the original `RunEvaluatorInputMapper`, which maps a run and example to a single input. \r\n\r\nExample usage running the for an LLM, Chat Model, and Agent.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Test running for the string evaluators\r\nevaluator_names = [\"qa\", \"criteria\"]\r\n\r\nmodel = ChatOpenAI()\r\nconfigured_evaluators = load_run_evaluators_for_model(evaluator_names, model=model, reference_key=\"answer\")\r\nrun_on_dataset(ds_name, model, run_evaluators=configured_evaluators)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Full code with dataset upload</summary>\r\n```\r\n## Create dataset\r\nfrom langchain.evaluation.run_evaluators.loading import load_run_evaluators_for_model\r\nfrom langchain.evaluation import load_dataset\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nlcds = load_dataset(\"llm-math\")\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(lcds)\r\n\r\nfrom uuid import uuid4\r\nfrom langsmith import Client\r\nclient = Client()\r\nds_name = \"llm-math - \" + str(uuid4())[0:8]\r\nds = client.upload_dataframe(df, name=ds_name, input_keys=[\"question\"], output_keys=[\"answer\"])\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Define the models we'll test over\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType\r\n\r\nfrom langchain.tools import tool\r\n\r\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\r\nchat_model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)\r\n\r\n@tool\r\n    def sum(a: float, b: float) -> float:\r\n        \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\"\r\n        return a + b\r\n    \r\ndef construct_agent():\r\n    return initialize_agent(\r\n        llm=chat_model,\r\n        tools=[sum],\r\n        agent=AgentType.OPENAI_MULTI_FUNCTIONS,\r\n    )\r\n\r\nagent = construct_agent()\r\n\r\n# Test running for the string evaluators\r\nevaluator_names = [\"qa\", \"criteria\"]\r\n\r\nmodels = [llm, chat_model, agent]\r\nrun_evaluators = []\r\nfor model in models:\r\n    run_evaluators.append(load_run_evaluators_for_model(evaluator_names, model=model, reference_key=\"answer\"))\r\n    \r\n\r\n# Run on LLM, Chat Model, and Agent\r\nfrom langchain.client.runner_utils import run_on_dataset\r\n\r\nto_test = [llm, chat_model, construct_agent]\r\n\r\nfor model, configured_evaluators in zip(to_test, run_evaluators):\r\n    run_on_dataset(ds_name, model, run_evaluators=configured_evaluators, verbose=True)\r\n```\r\n</details>",

But either two docstores should be created assuming same id value for all the elements of `texts` or an error should be raised.\r\n  \r\n  - **Issue**: My change fixes this by using dictionary comprehension instead of `zip`.

I bring to you:\r\n**The Fellowship of the Vectors**, AKA EmbeddingsClusteringFilter.\r\nThis document filter uses embeddings to group vectors together into clusters, then allows you to pick an arbitrary number of documents vector based on proximity to the cluster centers. That's a representative sample of the cluster.\r\n\r\nThe original idea is from [Greg Kamradt](https://github.com/gkamradt) from this video (Level4):\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaPMdcCqtWk&t=365s\r\n\r\nI added few tricks to make it a bit more versatile, so you can parametrize what to do with duplicate documents in case of cluster overlap: replace the duplicates with the next closest document or remove it. This allow you to use it as an special kind of redundant filter too.\r\nAdditionally you can choose 2 diff orders:  grouped by cluster or respecting the original retriever scores.\r\nIn my use case I was using the docs grouped by cluster to run refine chains per cluster to generate summarization over a large corpus of documents.\r\nLet me know if you want to change anything!\r\n\r\n@rlancemartin, @eyurtsev, @hwchase17, \r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "This fixes #4833 and the critical vulnerability https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34540\r\n\r\nPreviously, the JIRA API Wrapper had a mode that simply pipelined user input into an `exec()` function.\r\n[The intended use of the 'other' mode is to cover any of Atlassian's API that don't have an existing interface](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/cc33bde74ff2e050a400e4451e04ff5b32c4a7bd/langchain/tools/jira/prompt.py#L24)\r\n\r\nFortunately all of the [Atlassian JIRA API methods are subfunctions of their `Jira` class](https://atlassian-python-api.readthedocs.io/jira.html), so this implementation calls these subfunctions directly.\r\n\r\nAs well as passing a string representation of the function to call, the implementation flexibly allows for optionally passing args and/or keyword-args. These are given as part of the dictionary input. Example:\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        \"function\": \"update_issue_field\",   #function to execute\r\n        \"args\": [                           #list of ordered args similar to other examples in this JiraAPIWrapper\r\n            \"key\",\r\n            {\"summary\": \"New summary\"}\r\n        ],\r\n        \"kwargs\": {}                        #dict of key value keyword-args pairs\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe above is equivalent to `self.jira.update_issue_field(\"key\", {\"summary\": \"New summary\"})`\r\n\r\nAlternate query schema designs are welcome to make querying easier without passing and evaluating arbitrary python code. I considered parsing (without evaluating) input python code and extracting the function, args, and kwargs from there and then pipelining them into the callable function via `*f(args, **kwargs)` - but this seemed more direct.\r\n\r\n@vowelparrot @dev2049 \r\n\r\n\r\n",

But, retrieval may produce difference results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious.\r\n\r\nThe `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given  user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results.",

        "body": "### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at building on #4378, expanding the capabilities and building on top of the `cassIO` library to interface with the database (as opposed to using the core drivers directly).\r\n\r\nUsage of `cassIO` (a library abstracting Cassandra access for ML/GenAI-specific purposes) is already established since #6426  was merged, so no new dependencies are introduced.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit, we try to uniform the interface for using Cassandra instances throughout LangChain: all our appreciation of the work by @jj701 notwithstanding, who paved the way for this incremental work (thank you!), we identified a few reasons for changing the way a `CassandraChatMessageHistory` is instantiated. Advocating a syntax change is something we don't take lighthearted way, so we add some explanations about this below.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR expands on integration testing, enables use of Cassandra's native Time-to-Live (TTL) features and improves the phrasing around the notebook example and the short \"integrations\" documentation paragraph.\r\n\r\nWe would kindly request @hwchase to review (since this is an elaboration and proposed improvement of #4378 who had the same reviewer).\r\n\r\n### About the __init__ breaking changes\r\n\r\nThere are [many](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/3.28/api/cassandra/cluster/) options when creating the `Cluster` object, and new ones might be added at any time. Choosing some of them and exposing them as `__init__` parameters `CassandraChatMessageHistory`  will prove to be insufficient for at least some users.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, working through `kwargs` or adding a long, long list of arguments to `__init__` is not a desirable option either. For this reason, (as done in #6426), we propose that whoever instantiates the Chat Message History class provide a Cassandra `Session` object, ready to use. This also enables easier injection of mocks and usage of Cassandra-compatible connections (such as those to the cloud database DataStax Astra DB, obtained with a different set of init parameters than `contact_points` and `port`).\r\n\r\nWe feel that a breaking change might still be acceptable since LangChain is at `0.*`. However, while maintaining that the approach we propose will be more flexible in the future, room could be made for a \"compatibility layer\" that respects the current init method. Honestly, we would to that only if there are strong reasons for it, as that would entail an additional maintenance burden.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\nWe propose to remove the keyspace creation from the class code for two reasons: first, production Cassandra instances often employ RBAC so that the database user reading/writing from tables does not necessarily (and generally shouldn't) have permission to create keyspaces, and second that programmatic keyspace creation is not a best practice (it should be done more or less manually, with extra care about schema mismatched among nodes, etc). Removing this (usually unnecessary) operation from the `__init__` path would also improve initialization performance (shorter time).\r\n\r\nWe suggest, likewise, to remove the `__del__` method (which would close the database connection), for the following reason: it is the recommended best practice to create a single Cassandra `Session` object throughout an application (it is a resource-heavy object capable to handle concurrency internally), so in case Cassandra is used in other ways by the app there is the risk of truncating the connection for all usages when the history instance is destroyed. Moreover, the `Session` object, in typical applications, is best left to garbage-collect itself automatically.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, we defer the actual database I/O to the `cassIO` library, which is designed to encode practices optimized for LLM applications (among other) without the need to expose LangChain developers to the internals of CQL (Cassandra Query Language). CassIO is already employed by the LangChain's Vector Store support for Cassandra.\r\n\r\nWe added a few more connection options in the companion notebook example (most notably, Astra DB) to encourage usage by anyone who cannot run their own Cassandra cluster.\r\n\r\nWe surface the `ttl_seconds` option for automatic handling of an expiration time to chat history messages, a likely useful feature given that very old messages generally may lose their importance.\r\n\r\nWe elaborated a bit more on the integration testing (Time-to-live, separation of \"session ids\", ...).\r\n\r\n### Remarks from linter & co.\r\n\r\nWe reinstated `cassio` as a dependency both in the \"optional\" group and in the \"integration testing\" group of `pyproject.toml`. This might not be the right thing do to, in which case the author of this PR offer his apologies (lack of confidence with Poetry - happy to be pointed in the right direction, though!).\r\n\r\nDuring linter tests, we were hit by some errors which appear unrelated to the code in the PR. We left them here and report on them here for awareness:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlangchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:137: error: Argument 1 to \"insert_many\" of \"Collection\" has incompatible type \"List[Dict[str, Sequence[object]]]\"; expected \"Iterable[Union[MongoDBDocumentType, RawBSONDocument]]\"  [arg-type]\r\nlangchain/vectorstores/mongodb_atlas.py:186: error: Argument 1 to \"aggregate\" of \"Collection\" has incompatible type \"List[object]\"; expected \"Sequence[Mapping[str, Any]]\"  [arg-type]\r\n\r\nlangchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:16: error: Name \"grpc\" is not defined  [name-defined]\r\nlangchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:19: error: Name \"grpc\" is not defined  [name-defined]\r\nlangchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:20: error: Name \"grpc\" is not defined  [name-defined]\r\nlangchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:22: error: Name \"grpc\" is not defined  [name-defined]\r\nlangchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py:23: error: Name \"grpc\" is not defined  [name-defined]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit, we observe that to even get `import langchain` run, it seems that a `pip install bs4` is missing from the minimal package installation path.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n",

Metadata includes the text, paragraph number, pdf relative bboxes, pages (text may overlap over two pages), section title (Introduction, Methodology etc), section_number (i.e 1.1, 2.3), the title of the paper and finally the file path.\r\n      \r\nGrobid parsing is useful beyond standard pdf parsing as it accurately outputs sections and paragraphs within them. This allows for post-fitering of results for specific sections i.e. limiting results to the methodology section or results. While sections are split via headings, ideally they could be classified specifically into introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion. I'm currently experimenting with chatgpt-3.5 for this function, which could later be implemented as a textsplitter. \r\n\r\n`Dependencies:`\r\nFor use, the grobid repo must be cloned and Java must be installed, for colab this is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n!apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk -q\r\n!update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java\r\n!git clone https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid.git\r\nos.environ[\"JAVA_HOME\"] = \"/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64\"\r\nos.chdir('grobid')\r\n!./gradlew clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce installed the server is ran on localhost:8070 via\r\n```\r\nget_ipython().system_raw('nohup ./gradlew run > grobid.log 2>&1 &')\r\n```\r\n\r\n@rlancemartin, @eyurtsev\r\n\r\nTwitter Handle: @Corranmac\r\n\r\nGrobid Demo Notebook is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X-St_mQRmmm8YWtct_tcJNtoktbdGBmd?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n",

The program runs as expected, but the Q&A experience is less than optimal. I've identified two main issues:\r\n\r\nWhen summarizing the question using condense_question, the response prompt generated by load_qa_chain is treated as 'Human' rather than 'AI'. Currently, I am remedying this by determining whether to pass the question to human_message or ai_message, based on whether chat_history is provided through an external interface.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the code, I noticed that the answer is first generated by self.question_generator, but in reality, the desired answer initially comes from the prompt in combine_docs_chain_kwargs. However, this response is then re-fed into self.combine_docs_chain, leading to a situation of self-posed questions and self-given answers, which isn't ideal. The final answer from combine_docs_chain isn't what I'm looking for, and I see no need to go through another loop only to end up with an unsatisfactory answer. Thus, I wish to adjust the logic for obtaining the answer in the call and acall methods.\r\n\r\nWhile my implementation might not be the most ideal, it considerably enhances the Q&A experience based on chat history in my project. I hope for official support on this issue and appreciate your help. Thank you!\r\n\r\nBefore submitting",

If some extra context has to be provided apart from conversation history and database, like `extra_context1` and `extra_context2`, `RetrievalQA` cannot currently handle it.\r\n\r\nWith this change one can simply provide extra keys in in the `.run()` function of `RetrievalQA`. Like so:\r\n```python\r\nqa = KwargsRetrievalQA.from_chain_type(\r\n    llm=ChatOpenAI(),\r\n    chain_type='stuff',\r\n    retriever=retriever,\r\n    verbose=False,\r\n    chain_type_kwargs={\r\n        \"verbose\": True,\r\n        \"prompt\": prompt_template,\r\n        \"memory\": memory,\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n\r\ninp = input(\"Human: \")\r\nquery = inp\r\n\r\nresponse = qa.run(\r\n    query=query,\r\n    history=memory,\r\n    extra_context1=extra_context1,\r\n    extra_context2=extra_context2,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Maintainer\r\n@rlancemartin ",

        "body": "Description:\r\nThis PR adds a new Chain called `MlflowRetrieverEvaluator`, which is a wrapper of a retriever object used in the `RetrievalQA` chain. The wrapper is used for logging the retriever part to MLflow, in order to evaluate the retrieval model separately.\r\n\r\nA bit more context about what the MlflowRetrieverEvaluator chain is supposed to be used for: When a user is developing a `RetrievalQA` chain, they may want to evaluate the retriever by itself, without sending the documents to an llm. Tools will be provided to help the evaluation in `mlflow.evaluate()`. In order to use the `mlflow.evaluate()`, the retriever needs to be logged as an mlflow langchain flavor model, which accepts a Chain. So we introduce the `MlflowRetrieverEvaluator` Chain, which is essentially a wrapper around the retriever object.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n1. If a user doesn't want to evaluate the retriever by itself, their code would not be affected. (We are not proposing to force all the retrievers to be wrapped in this chain.)\r\n2. If a user want to evaluate the retriever by itself, they can leverage the new `MlflowRetrieverEvaluator` chain to do the evaluation. However, this doesn't change how their `RetrievalQA` chain works.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/8808 for more context.\r\n\r\n@dev2049 @hwchase17 \r\n\r\nThis PR enables the following use case with MLflow:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# I have a retrieval model: db\r\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\r\ndb = FAISS.load_local(local_dir, embeddings)\r\n\r\n# I can log db using mlflow langchain flavor:\r\n# First, wrap the retriever in the MlflowRetrieverEvaluator Chain\r\n# Added to LangChain in this PR https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/6602\r\nfrom langchain.chains.retriever import MlflowRetrieverEvaluator\r\nretriever_evaluator = MlflowRetrieverEvaluator(retriever=db.as_retriever())\r\n\r\n# Second, define the loader_fn and persist_dir, as with RetrievalQA Chain\r\ndef load_retriever(persist_directory):\r\n    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\r\n    vectorstore = FAISS.load_local(persist_directory, embeddings)\r\n    return vectorstore.as_retriever()\r\nlocal_dir = '/Users/liang.zhang/faiss_index'\r\n\r\n# Third, log the model\r\nlogged_model = mlflow.langchain.log_model(retriever_evaluator, \"retriever_evaluator\", loader_fn=load_retriever, persist_dir=local_dir)\r\n\r\n# You can load the model in pyfunc flavor:\r\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(logged_model.model_uri)\r\n\r\n# You can retrieve the documents by running predict:\r\nloaded_model.predict([{\"query\": \"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\"}])\r\n\r\n# The return value is the same as\r\n# db.as_retriever().get_relevant_documents(\"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\")\r\n```\r\nThe return value of the last statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[Document(lc_kwargs={'page_content': 'Tonight.

Within the `openai` Python library, for OpenAI requests, this [makes a call](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/openai/api_resources/abstract/engine_api_resource.py#L58) to an endpoint of the form `https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/embeddings`. \r\n\r\nThese endpoints are [deprecated](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6283125-what-happened-to-engines) in favor of endpoints of the format `https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings`, where `model` is passed as a parameter in the request body.\r\n\r\nWhile these deprecated endpoints continue to function for now, they may not be supported indefinitely and should be avoided in favor of the newer API format.\r\n\r\nIt appears that `engine` was passed in instead of `model` to make both Azure OpenAI and OpenAI calls work similarly. However, the inclusion of `engine` [causes](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/openai/api_resources/abstract/engine_api_resource.py#L58) OpenAI to use the deprecated endpoint, requiring a diverging code path for Azure OpenAI calls where `engine` is passed in additionally (Azure OpenAI requires `engine` to specify a deployment, and can optionally take in `model`).\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, it may be worth considering spinning off Azure OpenAI embeddings into a separate class for ease of use and maintenance, similar to the [implementation for chat models](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/chat_models/azure_openai.py).\r\n\r\n  - Tag maintainer: @dev2049 @hwchase17 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Previous 'custom_headers' flag did not work as it wasn't hooked into the _EXTRA_LLM_TOOLS dict correctly, fixed that\r\n2. Addition of flag for custom_transport_auth which enables signing request with sigV4 (aws appsync benefits from this)\r\n3.

Adds a try ... except around execution as not all graphql errors are serializable as langchain wants, prevents chain from crashing in these cases\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\nUsers can now use more diverse auth modes and have a more streamlined code implementation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Using an Api Key\r\nappsync_tool = load_tools(\r\n  ['graphql'], \r\n  graphql_endpoint=\"...\", \r\n  custom_headers={'x-api-key': '...'}, \r\n  llm=OpenAI()\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Using AWS IAM signing\r\n\r\ncredentials = boto3.Session().get_credentials()\r\nregion = os.getenv(\"AWS_REGION\", \"us-east-1\")\r\n\r\nawsauth = AWS4Auth(\r\n    credentials.access_key,\r\n    credentials.secret_key,\r\n    region,\r\n    \"appsync\",\r\n    session_token=credentials.token,\r\n)\r\n\r\nappsync_signed_requests_tool = load_tools(\r\n  ['graphql'], \r\n  graphql_endpoint=\"...\", \r\n  custom_transport_auth=awsauth,\r\n  llm=OpenAI()\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases there is no longer a need for the schema to be provided, its now pulled automatically.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Using an agent like this\r\nagent = initialize_agent(\r\n    appsync_tool,\r\n    llm,\r\n    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\r\n    verbose=True,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then query with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nagent.run('Who is not friends with bailey?')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen results in a prompt like below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnswer the following questions as best you can.

However, Chroma can update multiple documents by taking a list of IDs and documents for batch updates. If we update 'update_document' function both document_id and document can be `Union[str, List[str]]` but we need to do type check. Because embed_documents and update functions takes List for text and document_ids variables. I believe that, writing a new function is the best option.\r\n\r\nI update the Chroma vectorstore with refreshed information from my website every 20 minutes. Updating the update_document function to perform simultaneous updates for each changed piece of information would significantly reduce the update time in such use cases. \r\n\r\nFor my case I update a total of 8810 chunks. Updating these 8810 individual chunks using the current function takes a total of 8.5 minutes. However, if we process the inputs in batches and update them collectively, all 8810 separate chunks can be updated in just 1 minute. This significantly reduces the time it takes for users of actively used chatbots to access up-to-date information.\r\n\r\nI can add an integration test and an example for the documentation for the new update_document_batch function.\r\n\r\n@hwchase17 \r\n\r\n[berkedilekoglu](https://twitter.com/berkedilekoglu)",

From what I understood, the filter feature takes in a dict of form {key: value} which then will check in the metadata for the exact value linked to that key.\r\nI added some logic to be able to pass a list which will be checked against instead of an exact value. Passing an exact value will also work.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how I could then use it in my own project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    pdfs_to_filter_in = [\"file_A\", \"file_B\"]\r\n    filter_dict = {\r\n        \"source\": [f\"source_pdfs/{pdf_name}.pdf\" for pdf_name in pdfs_to_filter_in]\r\n    }\r\n    retriever = db.as_retriever()\r\n    retriever.search_kwargs = {\"filter\": filter_dict}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added an integration test based on the other ones I found in `tests/integration_tests/vectorstores/test_faiss.py` under `test_faiss_with_metadatas_and_list_filter()`.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't feel like this is worthy of its own notebook or doc, but I'm open to suggestions if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Who can review?\r\n\r\nTag maintainers/contributors who might be interested:\r\n\r\n<!-- For a quicker response, figure out the right person to tag with @\r\n\r\n  @hwchase17 - project lead\r\n\r\n  Tracing / Callbacks\r\n  - @agola11\r\n\r\n  Async\r\n  - @agola11\r\n\r\n  DataLoaders\r\n  - @eyurtsev\r\n\r\n  Models\r\n  - @hwchase17\r\n  - @agola11\r\n\r\n  Agents / Tools / Toolkits\r\n  - @hwchase17\r\n\r\n  VectorStores / Retrievers / Memory\r\n  - @dev2049\r\n\r\n -->\r\nVectorStores related: @dev2049 ",

The change involves adding a prompt template as an optional parameter for the RetrievalQA chains that utilize the recently implemented OpenAI Functions.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this enhancement is to provide users with the ability to input a more customizable prompt to the chain. By introducing a prompt template as an optional parameter, users can tailor the prompt to their specific needs and context, thereby improving the flexibility and effectiveness of the RetrievalQA chains.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n- Created a new optional parameter, \"prompt\", for the RetrievalQA with structure chains.\r\n- Added an example to the RetrievalQA with sources notebook.\r\n\r\nMy twitter handle is @El_Rey_Zero",

The Model Catalog contains a variety of open source and Hugging Face models that users can deploy on AzureML.

Then, an additional document is created with the top-level code, but without the already loaded functions and classes.\r\n\r\nThis could improve the accuracy of QA chains over source code.\r\n\r\nFor instance, having this script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    def __init__(self, name):\r\n        self.name = name\r\n\r\n    def greet(self):\r\n        print(f\"Hello, {self.name}!\")\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\r\n    obj = MyClass(name)\r\n    obj.greet()\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe loader will create three documents with this content:\r\n\r\nFirst document:\r\n```\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    def __init__(self, name):\r\n        self.name = name\r\n\r\n    def greet(self):\r\n        print(f\"Hello, {self.name}!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond document:\r\n```\r\ndef main():\r\n    name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\r\n    obj = MyClass(name)\r\n    obj.greet()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThird document:\r\n```\r\n# Code for: class MyClass:\r\n\r\n# Code for: def main():\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nA threshold parameter is added to control whether small scripts are split in this way or not.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, only Python and JavaScript are supported. The appropriate parser is determined by examining the file extension.\r\n\r\n#### Tests\r\n\r\nThis PR adds:\r\n\r\n- Unit tests\r\n- Integration tests\r\n\r\n#### Dependencies\r\n\r\nOnly one dependency was added as optional (needed for the JavaScript parser).\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\nA notebook is added showing how the loader can be used.\r\n\r\n#### Who can review?\r\n\r\n@eyurtsev @hwchase17\r\n\r\n",

The program runs as expected, but the Q&A experience is less than optimal. I've identified two main issues:\r\n\r\nWhen summarizing the question using condense_question, the response prompt generated by load_qa_chain is treated as 'Human' rather than 'AI'. Currently, I am remedying this by determining whether to pass the question to human_message or ai_message, based on whether chat_history is provided through an external interface.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the code, I noticed that the answer is first generated by self.question_generator, but in reality, the desired answer initially comes from the prompt in combine_docs_chain_kwargs. However, this response is then re-fed into self.combine_docs_chain, leading to a situation of self-posed questions and self-given answers, which isn't ideal. The final answer from combine_docs_chain isn't what I'm looking for, and I see no need to go through another loop only to end up with an unsatisfactory answer. Thus, I wish to adjust the logic for obtaining the answer in the call and acall methods.\r\n\r\nWhile my implementation might not be the most ideal, it considerably enhances the Q&A experience based on chat history in my project. I hope for official support on this issue and appreciate your help.

CassIO, in turn, uses the `cassandra-driver` low-lever drivers to communicate with the database. The former is added as optional dependency (+ in `extended_testing`), the latter was already in the project.\r\n\r\nIntegration testing relies on a locally-running instance of Cassandra. [Here](https://cassio.org/more_info/#use-a-local-vector-capable-cassandra) a detailed description can be found on how to compile and run it (at the time of writing the feature has not made it yet to a release).\r\n\r\nDuring development of the integration tests, I added a new \"fake embedding\" class for what I consider a more controlled way of testing the MMR search method. Likewise, I had to amend what looked like a glitch in the behaviour of `ConsistentFakeEmbeddings` whereby an `embed_query` call would have bypassed storage of the requested text in the class cache for use in later repeated invocations.\r\n\r\n@dev2049 might be the right person to tag here for a review.

        "body": "While using the ConversationalRetrievalChain, and specifically applying both `condense_question_prompt` and `combine_docs_chain_kwargs` parameters, I followed the official documentation to pass `chat_history` when invoking this chain. The program runs as expected, but the Q&A experience is less than optimal. I've identified two main issues:\r\n\r\n1. When summarizing the question using `condense_question`, the response prompt generated by `load_qa_chain` is treated as 'Human' rather than 'AI'. Currently, I am remedying this by determining whether to pass the question to `human_message` or `ai_message`, based on whether `chat_history` is provided through an external interface.\r\n\r\n2. Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that the answer is first generated by `self.question_generator`, but in reality, the desired answer initially comes from the `prompt` in `combine_docs_chain_kwargs`. However, this response is then re-fed into `self.combine_docs_chain`, leading to a situation of self-posed questions and self-given answers, which isn't ideal. The final answer from `combine_docs_chain` isn't what I'm looking for, and I see no need to go through another loop only to end up with an unsatisfactory answer. Thus, I wish to adjust the logic for obtaining the answer in the `call` and `acall` methods.\r\n\r\nWhile my implementation might not be the most ideal, it considerably enhances the Q&A experience based on chat history in my project. I hope for official support on this issue and appreciate your help. Thank you!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing to LangChain! Your PR will appear in our release under the title you set.

The GMail tool, empowered by structured tools, now supports multiple arguments and powerful search capabilities, demonstrating LangChain's ability to interact with dynamic data sources like email servers.\r\n\r\n#### Challenge\r\nThe current GMail tool only supports GMail, while users often utilize other email services like Outlook in Office365. Additionally, the proposed calendar tool in PR https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/652 only works with Google Calendar, not Outlook.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\nThis PR implements an Office365 integration for LangChain, enabling seamless email and calendar functionality with a single authentication process.\r\n\r\n#### Future Work\r\nWith the core Office365 integration complete, future work could include integrating other Office365 tools such as Tasks and Address Book.\r\n\r\n#### Who can review?\r\n@hwchase17 or @vowelparrot can review this PR\r\n\r\n#### Appendix\r\n@janscas, I utilized your [O365](https://github.com/O365/python-o365) library extensively. Given the rising popularity of LangChain and similar AI frameworks, the convergence of libraries like O365 and tools like this one is likely. So, I wanted to keep you updated on our progress.",

        "body": "# Causal program-aided language (CPAL) chain\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis builds on the recent Program-aided Language ([PAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10435)) approach to stop LLM hallucination. The problem with the [PAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10435) approach is that it hallucinates on a math problem with a nested chain of dependence. The innovation here is that this new CPAL approach includes causal structure to fix hallucination.\r\n\r\nFor example, using the below word problem, PAL answers with 5, and CPAL answers with 13.\r\n\r\n    \"Tim buys the same number of pets as Cindy and Boris.\"\r\n    \"Cindy buys the same number of pets as Bill plus Bob.\"\r\n    \"Boris buys the same number of pets as Ben plus Beth.\"\r\n    \"Bill buys the same number of pets as Obama.\"\r\n    \"Bob buys the same number of pets as Obama.\"\r\n    \"Ben buys the same number of pets as Obama.\"\r\n    \"Beth buys the same number of pets as Obama.\"\r\n    \"If Obama buys one pet, how many pets total does everyone buy?\"\r\n\r\nThe CPAL chain represents the causal structure of the above narrative as a causal graph or DAG, which it can also plot, as shown below. \r\n\r\n![complex-graph](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/assets/367522/d938db15-f941-493d-8605-536ad530f576)\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe two major sections below are:\r\n\r\n1. Technical overview\r\n2. Future application\r\n\r\nAlso see [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/borisdev/langchain/blob/master/docs/extras/modules/chains/additional/cpal.ipynb) doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Technical overview\r\n\r\n### CPAL versus PAL\r\n\r\nLike [PAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10435), CPAL intends to reduce large language model (LLM) hallucination. \r\n\r\nThe CPAL chain is different from the PAL chain for a couple of reasons. \r\n\r\n* CPAL adds a causal structure (or DAG) to link entity actions (or math expressions).  \r\n* The CPAL math expressions are modeling a chain of cause and effect relations, which can be intervened upon, whereas for the PAL chain math expressions are projected math identities. \r\n\r\nPAL's generated python code is wrong.

Story plot or causal model\r\n  4. Hypothetical question\r\n  5. Hypothetical condition \r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\n\r\nPreliminary evaluation on simple math word problems shows that this CPAL chain generates less hallucination than the PAL chain on answering questions about a causal narrative. Two examples are in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/borisdev/langchain/blob/master/docs/extras/modules/chains/additional/cpal.ipynb) doc.\r\n\r\n## 2. Future application\r\n\r\n### \"Describe as Narrative, Test as Code\"\r\n\r\nThe thesis here is that the Describe as Narrative, Test as Code approach allows you to represent a causal mental model both as code and as a narrative, giving you the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\n#### Why describe a causal mental mode as a narrative?\r\n\r\nThe narrative form is quick. At a consensus building meeting, people use narratives to persuade others of their causal mental model, aka. plan. You can share, version control and index a narrative.\r\n\r\n#### Why test a causal mental model as a code?\r\n\r\nCode is testable, complex narratives are not. Though fast, narratives are problematic as their complexity increases. The problem is LLMs and humans are prone to hallucination when predicting the outcomes of a narrative. The cost of building a consensus around the validity of a narrative outcome grows as its narrative complexity increases. Code does not require tribal knowledge or social power to validate. \r\n\r\nCode is composable, complex narratives are not. The answer of one CPAL chain can be the hypothetical conditions of another CPAL Chain. For stochastic simulations, a composable plan can be integrated with the [DoWhy library](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy). Lastly, for the futuristic folk, a composable plan as code allows ordinary community folk to design a plan that can be integrated with a blockchain for funding.  \r\n\r\nAn explanation of a dependency planning application is [here.](https://github.com/borisdev/cpal-llm-chain-demo)\r\n\r\n--- \r\nTwitter handle: @boris_dev\r\n",

By incorporating Infino into LangChain, users will be able to gain valuable insights and easily analyze the behavior of their language models.\r\n\r\n#### Please refer to the following files related to integration:\r\n- `InfinoCallbackHandler`: A [callback handler](https://github.com/naman-modi/langchain/blob/feature/infino-integration/langchain/callbacks/infino_callback.py) specifically designed for storing chain responses within Infino.\r\n- Example `infino.ipynb` file: A comprehensive notebook named [infino.ipynb](https://github.com/naman-modi/langchain/blob/feature/infino-integration/docs/extras/modules/callbacks/integrations/infino.ipynb) has been included to guide users on effectively leveraging Infino for tracking LangChain requests. \r\n- [Integration Doc](https://github.com/naman-modi/langchain/blob/feature/infino-integration/docs/extras/ecosystem/integrations/infino.mdx) for Infino integration.\r\n\r\nBy integrating Infino, LangChain users will gain access to powerful visualization and debugging capabilities. Infino enables easy tracking of inputs, outputs, token usage, execution time of LLMs. This comprehensive observability ensures a deeper understanding of individual executions and facilitates effective debugging.\r\n\r\nCo-authors: @vinaykakade @savannahar68\r\n\r\n### Who can review?\r\nI request @hwchase17, @agola11 and other community members for the review.",

[Rockset](https://rockset.com/blog/introducing-vector-search-on-rockset/) is a real time OLAP database which provides a fast and efficient vector search functionality. Further since it is entirely schemaless, it can store metadata in separate columns thereby allowing fast metadata filters during vector similarity search (as opposed to storing the entire metadata in a single JSON column). It currently supports three distance functions: `COSINE_SIMILARITY`, `EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE`, and `DOT_PRODUCT`. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds `rockset` client as an optional dependency. \r\n\r\nWe would love a twitter shoutout, our handle is https://twitter.com/RocksetCloud\r\n\r\n#### Before submitting\r\n\r\n1.

It takes about 30 minutes for this dev container to finish building in a Codespace, but a user should only have to experience this once. Through some online investigation, this doesn't seem unusual\r\n- Versions of poetry newer than 1.3.2 failed every time - based on some of the guidance in contributing.md and other online resources, it seemed changing poetry versions might be a good solution. 1.3.2 is from Jan 2023\r\n\r\n#### Who can review?\r\n\r\nTag maintainers/contributors who might be interested: @vowelparrot\r\n\r\nI was able to run through the various `make` commands mentioned in contributing.md successfully with this updated setup, and please let me know if there are questions or other tests I can help with to ensure everything is running well.

        "body": "# Expanded Self-Query Retriever \ud83d\udc40 and Self-querying with [MyScale](https://docs.myscale.com/en/) \ud83e\udd29\r\n\r\nLangChain is built with a great interface for self-query retrievers and many super nice contribution has been made during the last few weeks. \ud83c\udf1f Self-query retrievers are really cool and we believe it will be the future of vector databases! \ud83d\ude0e So we decided to expand self-query retriever with more functions and data types enabled and bring MyScale to the big family of self-query enabled vector databases! \ud83e\udd17\r\n\r\n[MyScale](https://docs.myscale.com/en/) can make use of [various data types and functions for filters](https://blog.myscale.com/2023/06/06/why-integrated-database-solution-can-boost-your-llm-apps/#filter-on-anything-without-constraints). It will boost up your LLM app no matter if you are scaling up your data or expand your system to broader application. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 And we believe it will be a common feature to every vector database in the future!\r\n\r\nIn the notebook we'll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` wrapped around a MyScale vector store with some extra piece we contributed to LangChain. In short, it can be concluded into 4 points:\r\n\r\n1. Add `contain` comparator \ud83e\udea3 to match list of any if there is more than one element matched\r\n2. Add `timestamp` data type \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f for date time match (ISO-format, or YYYY-MM-DD)\r\n3. Add `like` comparator \ud83d\udd0e for string pattern search\r\n4. Add arbitrary function \ud83d\udca3 capability. \r\n\r\nLet's boost LLM apps with vector databases! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing to LangChain!

Serve, deploy, and monitor any LLMs with ease.\r\n\r\nOpenLLM lets developers and researchers to easily run inference with any\r\nopen-source LLMs, deploy to the cloud or on-premises, build powerful AI apps,\r\nand fine tune your own LLM (coming soon...)\r\n\r\nIt currently supports ChatGLM, Dolly-v2, Flan-T5, Falcon, Starcoder, and more to\r\ncome. One can also easily start either a REST/gRPC server, which is powered by\r\nBentoML.\r\n\r\nNow that's out of the way, lets dive in!\r\n\r\nThe current depenedencies for this integration: `openllm`\r\n\r\nThis integrations brings a `OpenLLM` llms to LangChain, that can be used for\r\nboth running LLMs locally as well as interacting with a remote OpenLLM server.\r\n\r\nTo quickly start a local LLM, simply do the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenLLM\r\n\r\nllm = OpenLLM(model_name=\"dolly-v2\", model_id='databricks/dolly-v2-7b', device_map='auto')\r\n\r\nllm(\"What is the difference between a duck and a goose? And why there are so many Goose in Canada?\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n`langchain.llms.OpenLLM`, as mentioned above also have the capabilities to\r\ninteract with remote OpenLLM Server. Given there is a running OpenLLM server at\r\nhttp://44.23.123.1, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenLLM\r\n\r\nllm = OpenLLM(server_url='http://44.23.123.1:3000', server_type='grpc')\r\n\r\nllm(\"What is the difference between a duck and a goose? And why there are so many Goose in Canada?\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeatures soon to be open-sourced:\r\n\r\n- OpenAI compatible API, allowing users to easily use LangChain's OpenAI llm.\r\n- SSE support for OpenLLM server, allowing users to stream inference results.\r\n- Last but not least, easily fine-tune your own LLMs with `LLM.tuning()`\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I would love to hear feedback and response from the\r\ncommunity about the project, and feel free to reach out to me via Twitter\r\n@aarnphm_. \r\n\r\nFeel free to join our [Discord](https://l.bentoml.com/join-openllm-discord) to get the latest updates and developments.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Aaron <29749331+aarnphm@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n#### Before submitting\r\n\r\n<!-- If you're adding a new integration, please include:\r\n\r\n1. a test for the integration - favor unit tests that does not rely on network access.\r\n2. an example notebook showing its use\r\n\r\nSee contribution guidelines for more information on how to write tests, lint\r\netc:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI have added tests for this integration.\r\n\r\n#### Who can review?\r\n\r\nTag maintainers/contributors who might be interested:\r\n\r\n<!-- For a quicker response, figure out the right person to tag with @\r\n\r\n  @hwchase17 - project lead\r\n\r\n  Tracing / Callbacks\r\n  - @agola11\r\n\r\n  Async\r\n  - @agola11\r\n\r\n  DataLoaders\r\n  - @eyurtsev\r\n\r\n  Models\r\n  - @hwchase17\r\n  - @agola11\r\n\r\n  Agents / Tools / Toolkits\r\n  - @hwchase17\r\n\r\n  VectorStores / Retrievers / Memory\r\n  - @dev2049\r\n\r\n -->\r\n\r\ncc @hwchase17 @agola11 ",

It covers various scenarios including valid API calls, calls that result in errors, and the saving/loading of language model endpoints.\r\n\r\n**docs/modules/models/llms/integrations/octoai.ipynb**: This notebook shows how to use LangChain to interact with `OctoAI` [LLM endpoints](https://octoai.cloud/templates)\r\n\r\nPlease note that to use the newly added OctoAI's services, users should have the octoai python package installed `pip install octoai`, and the environment variables OCTOAI_API_TOKEN set with the API token and ENDPOINT_URL set with endpoint_url. The API token and endpoint URL can be obtained by cloning a template and creating an API token at https://octoai.cloud.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your review!\r\n\r\n@hwchase17 @agola11\r\n\r\n",

After investigation, it was found that the query method within the SnowflakeLoader was not properly fetching and processing the data. \r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n1. Modified the query method in SnowflakeLoader to handle data fetch and processing more accurately.\r\n2. Enhanced error handling within the SnowflakeLoader to catch and log potential issues that may arise during data loading.\r\n\r\n**Impact:**\r\n\r\nThis fix will ensure the SnowflakeLoader reliably returns the expected documents instead of empty ones, improving the efficiency and reliability of data processing tasks in the LangChain project.\r\n\r\nBefore Fix:\r\n\r\n`[\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={}),\r\n    Document(page_content='', metadata={})\r\n]`\r\n\r\nAfter Fix:\r\n\r\n`[Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 1\\nFIRST_NAME: John\\nLAST_NAME: Doe\\nEMAIL: john.doe@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-123-4567\\nADDRESS: 123 Elm St, San Francisco, CA 94102', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 2\\nFIRST_NAME: Jane\\nLAST_NAME: Doe\\nEMAIL: jane.doe@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-987-6543\\nADDRESS: 456 Oak St, San Francisco, CA 94103', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 3\\nFIRST_NAME: Michael\\nLAST_NAME: Smith\\nEMAIL: michael.smith@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-234-5678\\nADDRESS: 789 Pine St, San Francisco, CA 94104', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 4\\nFIRST_NAME: Emily\\nLAST_NAME: Johnson\\nEMAIL: emily.johnson@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-345-6789\\nADDRESS: 321 Maple St, San Francisco, CA 94105', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 5\\nFIRST_NAME: David\\nLAST_NAME: Williams\\nEMAIL: david.williams@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-456-7890\\nADDRESS: 654 Birch St, San Francisco, CA 94106', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 6\\nFIRST_NAME: Emma\\nLAST_NAME: Jones\\nEMAIL: emma.jones@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-567-8901\\nADDRESS: 987 Cedar St, San Francisco, CA 94107', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 7\\nFIRST_NAME: Oliver\\nLAST_NAME: Brown\\nEMAIL: oliver.brown@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-678-9012\\nADDRESS: 147 Cherry St, San Francisco, CA 94108', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 8\\nFIRST_NAME: Sophia\\nLAST_NAME: Davis\\nEMAIL: sophia.davis@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-789-0123\\nADDRESS: 369 Walnut St, San Francisco, CA 94109', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 9\\nFIRST_NAME: James\\nLAST_NAME: Taylor\\nEMAIL: james.taylor@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-890-1234\\nADDRESS: 258 Hawthorn St, San Francisco, CA 94110', metadata={}), Document(page_content='CUSTOMER_ID: 10\\nFIRST_NAME: Isabella\\nLAST_NAME: Wilson\\nEMAIL: isabella.wilson@example.com\\nPHONE: 555-901-2345\\nADDRESS: 963 Aspen St, San Francisco, CA 94111', metadata={})]\r\n`\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\n\r\nAll unit and integration tests have been run and passed successfully.

Here bothering people again!\r\n\r\nI'm using this simple idea to deal with merging the output of several retrievers into one.\r\nI'm aware of DocumentCompressorPipeline and ContextualCompressionRetriever but I don't think they allow us to do something like this. Also I was getting in trouble to get the pipeline working too. Please correct me if i'm wrong.\r\n\r\nThis allow to do some sort of \"retrieval\" preprocessing and then using the retrieval with the curated results anywhere you could use a retriever.\r\nMy use case is to generate diff indexes with diff embeddings and sources for a more colorful results then filtering them with one or many document formatters.\r\n\r\nI saw some people looking for something like this, here:\r\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/3991\r\nand something similar here:\r\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/5555\r\n\r\nThis is just a proposal I know I'm missing tests , etc. If you think this is a worth it idea I can work on tests and anything you want to change.\r\nLet me know!\r\n",

        "body": "### Title: Add Session-Based Context Storage to SessionVectorStoreRetrieverMemory\r\n\r\n#### Description:\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new feature to the `SessionVectorStoreRetrieverMemory` class that allows developers to store and retrieve the history of a particular chat session. It proposes a new class, `SessionVectorStoreRetrieverMemory`, which extends `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` and adds a `session_id` field. \r\n\r\nThe key changes include:\r\n\r\n- The addition of a `session_id` field, which will be used to uniquely identify a chat session. This will allow us to store and retrieve the history of a particular session.\r\n\r\n- Modifying the `_form_documents` method to attach the `session_id` to each document created. This means that each document in our vector store will now include information about the session it belongs to.\r\n\r\nThis feature requires the `VectorStoreRetriever` to support metadata filtering. For instance, you can create a retriever that filters on the `session_id` field as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport uuid\r\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.memory import SessionVectorStoreRetrieverMemory\r\n\r\n# generate a random session id\r\nsession_id = uuid.uuid4().hex\r\n\r\nembedding_fn = OpenAIEmbeddings()\r\n\r\nvec_store = Pinecone.from_existing_index(PINECONE_INDEX, embedding_fn, text_key=\"chat_memory\")\r\n\r\n# include session_id as param in retriever and memory object\r\nretriever = vec_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={'k': 1, 'filter': {'session_id': session_id}})\r\nmemory = SessionVectorStoreRetrieverMemory(retriever=retriever, session_id=session_id)  \r\n\r\nmemory.save_context({\"input\": \"My favorite food is pizza\"}, {\"output\": \"thats good to know\"})\r\nmemory.save_context({\"input\": \"My favorite sport is soccer\"}, {\"output\": \"...\"})\r\nmemory.save_context({\"input\": \"I don't the Celtics\"}, {\"output\": \"ok\"}) \r\n\r\nprint(memory.load_memory_variables({\"prompt\": \"what sport should i watch?\"})[\"history\"])\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis will ensure that only documents with the specified session_id are returned when a query is made.\r\n\r\nThe rationale behind these changes is to enable a finer granularity of data retrieval. Currently, the SessionVectorStoreRetrieverMemory class retrieves relevant documents based on a query without considering the context of a chat session. By adding the session_id, we can retrieve documents that are not only relevant to the query but also belong to the same chat session. This makes it possible to have more context-aware conversations and could improve the quality of our chatbot's responses, while maintaining privacy between sessions of different users.\r\n\r\nThe change is backward-compatible and does not affect the existing functionality of the SessionVectorStoreRetrieverMemory class. Developers can choose to use the session-based version or the original version depending on their needs.\r\n\r\nContributor: Adi Sidapara (Github: @asidapara, Twitter: @AdiSidapara)\r\n\r\nCould you review? @hwchase17 @dev2049 Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Some of these functions and data structures perform distance operations between vectors, [enabling ClickHouse to be used as a vector database](https://clickhouse.com/blog/vector-search-clickhouse-p1).  Recently added ClickHouse capabilities like [Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) indices](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/annindexes) support faster approximate matching of vectors and provide a promising development aimed to further enhance the vector matching capabilities of ClickHouse. \r\n\r\nIn LangChain, some ClickHouse based commercial variant vector stores like [Chroma](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/vectorstores/chroma.py) and [MyScale](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/vectorstores/myscale.py), etc are already integrated, but for some enterprises with large scale Clickhouse clusters deployment, it will be more straightforward to upgrade existing clickhouse infra instead of moving to another similar vector store solution, so we believe it's a valid requirement to integrate open source version of ClickHouse as vector store.\r\n\r\nAs `clickhouse-connect` is already included by other integrations, this PR won't include any new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Before submitting\r\n\r\n<!-- If you're adding a new integration, please include:\r\n\r\n1.

For instance in FAISS document: if we consider the score returned by the function as a similarity score, we understand that a document returning a higher score is more similar to the source document. However, since the scores returned by the function are distance scores, we should understand that smaller scores correspond to more similar documents.\r\n\r\nFor the libraries other than Vectara, I wrote the scores they use by investigating from the source libraries. Since I couldn't be certain about the score metric used by Vectara, I didn't make any changes in its documentation.

Besides the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` we've included a Jupyter Notebook to serve as a tutorial on how to use the callback to track the inputs and the responses that come into LangChain, to generate a dataset to be curated for LLM evaluation, monitoring, and potentially fine-tuning.\r\n\r\nBesides the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` itself, we've also included a Jupyter Notebook to show how to use it.\r\n\r\n# What's missing in this PR?\r\n\r\nWe didn't include any integration tests, since `argilla` relies on an Argilla Server deployed, and following the suggestions, tests that require a network connection are not preferred, that's why. But we could add those if needed during the review of this PR!\r\n\r\n# Who to mention?\r\n\r\nIf this PR moves forward, we'd love to be tagged:\r\n\r\n* In Twitter as https://twitter.com/argilla_io?lang=en\r\n* In LinkedIn as https://www.linkedin.com/company/argilla-io\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

Previously, if the model file was not found in the cache directory `~/.cache/gpt4all/`, the package returned error \"Failed to retrieve model (type=value_error)\". Now, if `allow_download` is set as True then it will use GPT4All package to download it . With the addition of the `allow_download` attribute, users can now choose whether the wrapper is allowed to download the model or not.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nThere are no new dependencies introduced by this change. It only utilizes existing functionality provided by the GPT4All package.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nSince this is a minor change to the existing behavior, the existing test suite for the GPT4All package should cover this scenario\r\n\r\n## Reviewers\r\n - @hwchase17\r\n - @agola11",

        "body": "This commit addresses a ValueError occurring when the YoutubeLoader class tries to add datetime metadata from a YouTube video's publish date. The error was happening because the ChromaDB metadata validation only accepts str, int, or float data types.\r\n\r\nIn the `_get_video_info` method of the `YoutubeLoader` class, the publish date retrieved from the YouTube video was of datetime type. This commit fixes the issue by converting the datetime object to a string before adding it to the metadata dictionary.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this commit introduces error handling in the `_get_video_info` method to ensure that all metadata fields have valid values. If a metadata field is found to be None, a default value is assigned. This prevents potential errors during metadata validation when metadata fields are None.\r\n\r\nThe file modified in this commit is youtube.py.\r\n\r\n# Your PR Title (What it does)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing to LangChain!

A searcher that searches for documents using a search engine.\r\n    - The searcher is responsible to return a list of URLs of documents that\r\n      may be relevant to read to be able to answer the question.\r\n2. A downloader that downloads the documents.\r\n3. An HTML to markdown parser (hard coded) that converts the HTML to markdown.\r\n    * Conversion to markdown is lossy\r\n    * However, it can significantly reduce the token count of the document\r\n    * Markdown helps to preserve some styling information\r\n      (e.g., bold, italics, links, headers) which is expected to help the reader\r\n      to answer certain kinds of questions correctly.\r\n4. A reader that reads the documents and produces an answer.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\n* Quality of results depends on LLM used, and can be improved by providing more specialized parsers (e.g., parse only the body of articles).\r\n* If asking about people, provide enough information to disambiguate the person.\r\n* Content downloader may get blocked (e.g., if attempting to download from linkedin) -- may need to read terms of service / user agents appropriately.\r\n* Chain can be potentially long running (use initialization parameters to control how many options are explored) -- use async implementation as it uses more concurrency.\r\n* This research chain only implements a single hop at the moment; i.e.,\r\n  it goes from the questions to a list of URLs to documents to compiling answers.\r\n  Without continuing the crawl, web-sites that require pagination will not be explored fully.\r\n* The reader chain must match the type of question. For example, the QA refine chain \r\n  isn't good at extracting a list of entries from a long document.\r\n  \r\n## Extending\r\n\r\n* Continue crawling documents to discover more relevant pages that were not surfaced by the search engine.\r\n* Adapt reading strategy based on nature of question.\r\n* Analyze the query and determine whether the query is a multi-hop query and change search/crawling strategy based on that.\r\n* Break components into tools that can be exposed to an agent. :)\r\n* Add cheaper strategies for selecting which links should be explored further (e.g., based on tf-idf similarity instead of gpt-4)\r\n* Add a summarization chain on top of the individually collected answers.\r\n* Improve strategy to ignore irrelevant information.",

The issue was identified as an `AttributeError` raised when calling `update_document` due to a missing corresponding method in the `Collection` object. This fix refactors the `update_document` method in `Chroma` to correctly interact with the `Collection` object.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n1. Fixed the `update_document` method in the `Chroma` class to correctly call methods on the `Collection` object.\r\n2. Added the corresponding test `test_chroma_update_document` in `tests/integration_tests/vectorstores/test_chroma.py` to reflect the updated method call.\r\n3. Added an example and explanation of how to use the `update_document` function in the Jupyter notebook tutorial for Chroma.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nAll existing tests pass after this change. In addition, the `test_chroma_update_document` test case now correctly checks the functionality of `update_document`, ensuring that the function works as expected and updates the content of documents correctly.\r\n\r\n## Reviewers\r\n@dev2049\r\n\r\nThis fix will ensure that users are able to use the `update_document` function as expected, without encountering the previous `AttributeError`. This will enhance the usability and reliability of the Chroma class for all users. \r\n\r\nThank you for considering this pull request. I look forward to your feedback and suggestions.\r\n",

        "body": "# Reduce DB query error rate\r\n\r\nIf you use sql agent of `SQLDatabaseToolkit` to query data, it is prone to errors in query fields and often uses fields that do not exist in database tables for queries. However, the existing prompt does not effectively make the agent aware that there are problems with the fields they query. At this time, we urgently need to improve the prompt so that the agent realizes that they have queried non-existent fields and allows them to use the `schema_sql_db`, that is,` ListSQLDatabaseTool` first queries the corresponding fields in the table in the database, and then uses  `QuerySQLDatabaseTool` for querying.\r\n\r\nThere is a demo of my project to show this problem.\r\n\r\n**Original Agent**\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef create_mysql_kit():\r\n    db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(\"mysql+pymysql://xxxxxxx\")\r\n    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\r\n\r\n    toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm)\r\n    agent_executor = create_sql_agent(\r\n        llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),\r\n        toolkit=toolkit,\r\n        verbose=True\r\n    )\r\n    agent_executor.run(\"Who are the users of sysuser in this system?

Langchain already has a Pandas DF loader and so extended support for Spark seemed to be the next step. The core issue is that Spark DataFrames are usually not just stored on one worker, so instead of doing a major code change to allow for `yield` functionality with Document Loaders, I simply just checked how much memory is available and set the max size for this DocumentLoader list as a certain fraction of it.

I've noticed that if you do that directly between the user's input and the lyrics the results are not great. So I've come up with what I've called LLMs tagging, basically:\r\n- you take the documents you want to embed and you use a LLMs to create a set of tags and you embed the tags\r\n- you take the user input and you use an LLMs to create the set of tags and you embed the tags\r\n- finally, you do similarity search between the tags\r\n\r\nI've build FairytaleDJ using this approach and I've written [an article](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/3-ways-to-build-a-recommendation-engine-for-songs-with-lang-chain/) and I also have a demo on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Francesco/FairytaleDJ)\r\n\r\nLet me know if markdown follows your standards \r\n\r\nThanks a lot \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nFra\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The proposed fix is the following:\r\n```python\r\n    def add_documents(self, documents: List[Document], **kwargs: Any) -> List[str]:\r\n        \"\"\"Add documents to vectorstore.\"\"\"\r\n        current_time = kwargs.get(\"current_time\", datetime.datetime.now())\r\n        # `current_time` may exist in kwargs, but may still have the value of None.\r\n        if current_time is None:\r\n            current_time = datetime.datetime.now()\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, we could just set the default of `now` to be `datetime.datetime.now()` everywhere instead. Thoughts @hwchase17? If we still want to keep the default to be `None`, then this PR should fix the above issue. If we want to set the default to be `datetime.datetime.now()` instead, I can update this PR with that alternative fix. EDIT: seems like from #5018 it looks like we would prefer to keep the default to be `None`, in which case this PR should fix the error.\r\n\r\n## Before submitting\r\n\r\n<!-- If you're adding a new integration, include an integration test and an example notebook showing its use! -->\r\n\r\n## Who can review?\r\n\r\nCommunity members can review the PR once tests pass.

        "body": "tldr: The docarray [integration\r\nPR](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/4483) introduced a pinned dependency to protobuf. This is a docarray dependency, not a langchain dependency. Since this is handled by the docarray dependencies, it is unnecessary here.\r\n\r\nFurther, as a pinned dependency, this quickly leads to incompatibilities with application code that consumes the library. Much less with a heavily used library like protobuf.\r\n\r\nDetail: as we see in the [docarray\r\nintegration](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/pull/4483/files#diff-50c86b7ed8ac2cf95bd48334961bf0530cdc77b5a56f852c5c61b89d735fd711R81-R83), the transitive dependencies of docarray were also listed as langchain dependencies. This is unnecessary as the docarray project has an appropriate [extras](https://github.com/docarray/docarray/blob/a01a05542d17264b8a164bec783633658deeedb8/pyproject.toml#L70). The docarray project also does not require this _pinned_ version of protobuf, rather [a minimum version](https://github.com/docarray/docarray/blob/a01a05542d17264b8a164bec783633658deeedb8/pyproject.toml#L41). So this pinned version was likely in error.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, this PR reverts the explicit hnswlib and protobuf dependencies and adds the hnswlib extras install for docarray (which installs hnswlib and protobuf, as originally intended). Because version `0.32.0`\r\nof the docarray hnswlib extras added protobuf, we bump the docarray dependency from `^0.31.0` to `^0.32.0`.\r\n\r\n# revert docarray explicit transitive dependencies and use extras instead\r\n\r\n## Who can review?\r\n\r\n@dev2049 -- reviewed the original PR\r\n@eyurtsev -- bumped the pinned protobuf dependency a few days ago\r\n",

The Pubmed integration allows users to retrieve scientific publications and related metadata from the Pubmed database.\r\n\r\nThe integration includes the following changes:\r\n- Implemented a Pubmed API client to communicate with the Pubmed database.\r\n- Added a new module, pubmed.py, to handle Pubmed-specific functionality.\r\n- Created functions to search for publications based on keywords, retrieve publication details by PMID (Pubmed ID), and fetch related metadata.\r\n\r\nThis integration enhances the capabilities of LangChain by enabling users to access a wide range of scientific publications and leverage the Pubmed database's extensive resources. Researchers, students, and anyone interested in the scientific literature can benefit from this integration to gather valuable information and incorporate it into their natural language processing tasks.\r\n\r\nI have followed the guidelines provided by the LangChain project, including formatting, and lining. The code has been thoroughly reviewed to ensure its quality and adherence to project standards.\r\n\r\nPlease review this pull request and let me know if any further changes or additions are required.

        "body": "# Make BaseStringMessagePromptTemplate.from_template return type generic\r\n\r\nI use mypy to check type on my code that uses langchain. Currently after I load a prompt and convert it to a system prompt I have to explicitly cast it which is quite ugly (and not necessary):\r\n```\r\nprompt_template = load_prompt(\"prompt.yaml\")\r\nsystem_prompt_template = cast(\r\n    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,\r\n    SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template.template),\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the code would simply be: \r\n```\r\nprompt_template = load_prompt(\"prompt.yaml\")\r\nsystem_prompt_template = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template.template)\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven how much langchain uses inheritance, I think this type hinting could be applied in a bunch more places, e.g. load_prompt also return a `FewShotPromptTemplate` or a `PromptTemplate` but without typing the type checkers aren't able to infer that. Let me know if you agree and I can take a look at implementing that as well.\r\n\r\n        @hwchase17 - project lead\r\n\r\n        DataLoaders\r\n        - @eyurtsev\r\n",

There are several reasons why a project should have a code of conduct:\r\n\r\n1. Promoting a welcoming and inclusive environment: A code of conduct establishes clear expectations for behavior and sets a standard for respectful communication and collaboration. It helps to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their background or identity.\r\n\r\n2. Preventing harassment and discrimination: A code of conduct provides a clear framework for addressing and reporting incidents of harassment or discrimination. It helps to create a culture of accountability and ensures that all community members are treated with respect.\r\n\r\n3. Fostering productive collaboration: A code of conduct can help to resolve conflicts and ensure that discussions remain focused on the project's goals. It can also help to establish guidelines for decision-making and ensure that contributions are evaluated fairly and objectively.\r\n\r\n4. Protecting the project's reputation: A well-written code of conduct can help to prevent inappropriate behavior and negative interactions that could harm the project's reputation. It can also help to attract a diverse range of contributors and users who value a respectful and inclusive community.\r\n\r\nOverall, a code of conduct is an important tool for maintaining a healthy and productive project community. It sets expectations for behavior, provides a framework for resolving conflicts, and helps to promote a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone involved in the project.",

        "body": "This commit adds support for passing additional arguments to the `SeleniumURLLoader ` when creating Chrome or Firefox web drivers. Previously, only a few arguments such as `headless` could be passed in. With this change, users can pass any additional arguments they need as a list of strings using the `arguments` parameter.\r\n\r\nThe `arguments` parameter allows users to configure the driver with any options that are available for that particular browser. For example, users can now pass custom `user_agent` strings or `proxy` settings using this parameter.\r\n\r\nThis change also includes updated documentation and type hints to reflect the new `arguments` parameter and its usage.\r\n\r\nfixes #4120",

        "body": "Dear Reviewers,\r\n\r\nI am pleased to present my latest pull request that includes exciting new changes to the existing codebase. I have implemented a new feature that enables users to directly authenticate and extract data from specific Telegram channels. This functionality offers a significant advantage over the previous version, which required users to read from a file path. With the new implementation, users can easily connect and integrate with Telegram, facilitating more efficient and accurate data extraction.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I have added a novel method that collects messages and their related responses in the form of a message thread, resulting in more accurate information retrieval. The output of this method is a Langchain document that streamlines data presentation and analysis. \r\n\r\nOverall, these changes represent a significant improvement in our codebase's functionality, enabling our users to extract data more efficiently and accurately. With the option of directly authenticating and connecting to Telegram or reading from a file path, users have greater flexibility and can choose the most suitable method for their requirements.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nBest regards",

This will allow callers to use their own type of vector store and does not force a specific tech. \r\n\r\nTo maintain the interface requirements of the chain, the chain attribution is added in the response text to indicate to the caller the downstream chain that's actually processing the request.

This technically breaks backwards compatibility  in that the function signature has been expanded. I think it's worth the tradeoff since\r\n   - New tool types are only now being introduced.\r\n   - Immediate concerns would be linting issues.\r\n   - Then there wouldn't be immediate validation checks for custom agents inheriting from the base Agent class trying to use new tools.\r\n- Added to the `validate_all_tools` for all the relevant existing agent implementations to ensure only instances of `BaseTool` are accepted.\r\n\r\nA couple obvious alternatives would be:\r\n- Create an entirely new set of agents (may end up with more copied code than desired and increases the cognitive load when building custom agents, I believe)\r\n- extract agent methods and properly refactor them (this isn't the most straightforward since there is already 4 levels of inheritance)\r\n\r\nCouple primary TODOs before this would be landed:\r\n- Update documentation\r\n- Create new agent to consume\r\n",

        "body": "This PR allows users to combine transformers with LLMs when ONLY using LLMs is not efficient. The goal is to give users the option to use a sparse transformer to decide which agent to use (aka meta-agent). This meta-agent decides whether a prompt is simple (single clause, requiring a single tool) or complex (multiple clauses requiring multiple tools). The idea is to give more resourceful option for interacting LLMs (since not all prompts require using ChatGPT). This in turn can be more cost-effective (less LLM API calls) and giving users a more deterministic approach when dealing with non-deterministic agents such as REACT/ChatGPT,  which can be valuable in production envs.\r\n\r\n2 sparse transformer models have already been trained: [meta-agent](https://huggingface.co/zeroshot/meta-agent) and [wolfram](https://huggingface.co/zeroshot/wolfram-agent). One model is to be used as a meta-agent, the other was created as an example use-case where users want to use wolfram API only for simple prompts (and NOT React unless the prompt is complex). These 2 models are currently being migrated to the [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/). Once migration is complete, will edit the <placeholder> variables in the `neuralmagic.py` file.\r\n\r\nDiagram below:\r\n\r\n![langchain_slide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79061523/234297674-dd10a177-ebdd-4dce-9c92-56c2d2404a49.png)\r\n",

It is just in a jupyter notebook for easy sharing, but as we finalize the interfaces I can integrate the classes into the actual code.\r\n\r\nMain things to pay attention to:\r\n- `Entity` base class\r\n- `BaseSimulator` base class\r\n- main loop (at the bottom of the notebook)\r\n\r\nIn order for us to make this more generic, I plan to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Allow for arbitrary roles. Currently the ChatOpenAI model only allows for \"system\", \"user\", \"assistant\", but this will not allow us to expand to multiple agents with different roles. This means I would need to use an standard LLM Chain with a ConversationBufferWindowMemory instead of ChatOpenAI model.\r\n2. Have `simulator.step()` take in a dictionary of messages and return a dictionary of messages. Currently we have hardcoded it to take exactly 2 messages as input and return 2 messages as output.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am not implementing `simulator.run()` to allow the user to write print statements and break statements, as we can see from the example.",

        "body": "This PR introduces a new module, `elasticsearch_embeddings.py`, which provides a wrapper around Elasticsearch embedding models. The new ElasticsearchEmbeddings class allows users to generate embeddings for documents and query texts using a [model deployed in an Elasticsearch cluster](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-model-ref.html#ml-nlp-model-ref-text-embedding).\r\n\r\n### Main features:\r\n\r\n1. The ElasticsearchEmbeddings class initializes with an Elasticsearch connection object and a model_id, providing an interface to interact with the Elasticsearch ML client through [infer_trained_model](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.7.0/api.html?highlight=trained%20model%20infer#elasticsearch.client.MlClient.infer_trained_model) .\r\n2. The `embed_documents()` method generates embeddings for a list of documents, and the `embed_query()` method generates an embedding for a single query text.\r\n3. The class supports custom input text field names in case the deployed model expects a different field name than the default `text_field`.\r\n4. The implementation is compatible with any model deployed in Elasticsearch that generates embeddings as output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Simplifies the process of generating embeddings using Elasticsearch models.\r\n2. Provides a clean and intuitive interface to interact with the Elasticsearch ML client.\r\n3. Allows users to easily integrate Elasticsearch-generated embeddings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR for this project.\r\nI created an integration test file, however, I could use some guidance on how to set it up since it needs an Elasticsearch cluster running an embedding model.  \r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any structural changes needed or anything missing.\r\n\r\nRelated issue https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/3400\r\n",

        "body": "## Problem and Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR solves #1793, which is more of a convenience for users than anything else. When using Chroma as a vectorstore, if you try to run similarity search with a `k`  value that is larger than the number of documents stored in the vectorstore, Chroma will raise a `chromadb.errors.NotEnoughElementsException`. \r\n\r\nThe workaround is to add a new parameter in all similarity search methods under the `Chroma` class called `find_highest_possible_k`, an optional boolean parameter that defaults to True (changes default behavior). If this parameter is set to `False`, the methods will behave exactly as they did before this PR.\r\n\r\nIf the parameter is `True`, however, the method will try running similarity search with the given `k`, and if `chromadb.errors.NotEnoughElementsException` is raised, iteratively lower `k` (down to `k=1`) until the error is no longer raised. \r\n\r\nThe following is an example of how this is implemented in the `Chroma.similarity_search` method.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/preritdas/langchain/blob/e0846c2bcaafa4f54a193a6a7dfa8ed46480c326/langchain/vectorstores/chroma.py#L127-L159\r\n\r\nWe add the `find_highest_possible_k` parameter as `Optional` and defaulting to True. We explain it briefly in the docstring. We wrap the previous similarity search logic inside a private local function that takes `k`. If `find_highest_possible_k` is False, we return that private function, retaining previous behavior. If it is True, which it is by default, we iteratively lower `k` (until it is 1) until we can find `k` documents from the Chroma vectorstore.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nYou create a `Chroma` object from 1 document. You then run `.similarity_search()`, `.similarity_search_by_vector()`, or `similarity_search_with_score()`. If you only pass a query, the default `k` is `4`. All methods would previously raise a `chromadb.errors.NotEnoughElementsException`. \r\n\r\nNow, however, all methods will return one document, the document inside the vectorstore (unless you're filtering, setting a maximum distance, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nI didn't find any places in the documentation to mention this change, other than the example Jupyter notebook for the Chroma vectorstore. In that notebook, there was never a cell running similarity search with parameters. If it's important to include information on altering the `find_highest_possible_k` parameter, I'll happily document it wherever. ",

Now `limit` is used *only* as a per-request pagination limit and `max_pages` is introduced as the way to limit the total number of pages returned by the paginator.\r\n - Document metadata now includes `source` (the source url), making it compatible with `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain`.\r\n - It is now possible to include inline and footer comments.\r\n - It is now possible to pass `verify_ssl=False` and other parameters to the confluence object for use cases that require it.",

        "body": "Related to: #3211 \r\n\r\n`SagemakerEndpointEmbeddings.embed_documents` batches documents and invokes the endpoint once per batch, meaning that the output of `_embedding_func` should be a *list of lists*, or one embedding vector per document. The current behavior will only return one vector *per batch*, rather than one vector per document.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that if you follow the [linked documentation](https://www.philschmid.de/custom-inference-huggingface-sagemaker) for setting up an embedding endpoint, the endpoint will only return the results for one input at a time. \r\n\r\nFrom the custom `inference.py` file in the tutorial, `predict_fn` only returns the embedding vector for the first input:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# inference.py\r\n...\r\ndef predict_fn():\r\n    ...\r\n    return {\"vectors\": sentence_embeddings[0].tolist()}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo to handle batched requests (i.e. lists of text snippets), you simply have to change this return line to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# return list of lists\r\nreturn {\"vectors\": sentence_embeddings.tolist()}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other change you have to make is to the `ContentHandler`, as `transform_input` should accept a list of strings as used in `_embedding_func`. I updated the documentation to show how this works. \r\n\r\nThe alternative is to get rid of the request batching and just make one `invoke_endpoint` call per document, but I agree that batching is the better way to go as long as your endpoint can support it. \r\n\r\nHope this makes sense! Love the project and happy to adjust based on design preferences.\r\n",

Instead of returning the entire YAML file of the plugin, only return the parsed schemas necessary to execute get & post requests against the plugin.

However this should probably be configurable by developers going forward.\r\n\r\n2. Instead of using the YAML to construct proper HTTP requests using the `requests_*` tools, I've changed the tool to accept `get` and `post` requests against the endpoints described by the YAML. This reduces the token length needed to communicate with the plugin as well.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think & how I can improve this PR! \ud83e\udd42 ",

Add a client attribute to the `Chroma` class to store the shared `chromadb.Client` instance.\r\n2. Modify the `from_documents` method to accept an optional client parameter.\r\n3. Update the `from_documents` method to use the shared client if provided or create a new client if not provided.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything needs to be modified - thanks again for your work on this incredible repo \r\n",

By default, the flag is set to True, which means the LLM will be applied as it was previously.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this change is to handle cases where API responses are too large and exceed the context window of the LLM. In such situations, using an LLM to analyze the JSON response may not be feasible due to costs and token limits. With the new apply_llm flag, users can still use the `OpenAPIEndpointChain` to translate natural language to API requests based on the OpenAPI specification but can opt out of using an LLM to analyze the JSON response if needed.\r\n\r\nTo use the new flag, a `call_with_apply_llm` method has been added to the `OpenAPIEndpointChain` class. Users can call this method with their query and the desired value for the `apply_llm` flag:\r\n\r\n`output = chain_.call_with_apply_llm(\"my query\", apply_llm=False)`\r\n\r\nBy setting `apply_llm` to `False`, the LLM will not be applied to the JSON API response, making it more suitable for handling large responses without exceeding token limits or incurring additional costs.\r\n\r\nThere are other potentially better ways to address this problem. Let me know if you have any suggestions and I'd be very happy to revise this PR. Thanks.\r\n",

        "body": "The main change proposed here is to introduce params as a third argument for the class `RequestsGetToolWithParsing` as well as the corresponding instruction prompt, `REQUESTS_GET_TOOL_DESCRIPTION`. \r\n\r\nI've tested this on a fork and it appears to be working. Previously I had observed behaviour in which the Agent would attempt to return/list all results then follow up with a filter or truncation (when a GET list endpoint is available). However, due to the `RESPONSE_LENGTH`, any paginated or long responses perform poorly in this approach. Therefore, adding the params query allows the Agent to default to params when available (and `None` if not applicable).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have experimented with shared memory for the planner Agent. It's unclear if it is having the desired effect, however it doesn't throw errors and in theory should give the Planner more context on the entire conversation.",

This is especially helpful in agent based simulations where LLMs can simulate individual agents. To be able to use LLMs in these use cases, it's critical that they provide response actions that are not only valid, but formatted correctly. Given the large context window of these scenarios, it's often the case that the LLM provides an invalid or incorrectly formatted decision.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThis chain helps format and validate actions that LLMs provide in response to situations. It does so by breaking up the prompting into multiple stages\r\n\r\n1. Presenting the scenario and asking for the chosen action\r\n2. Checking the validity of the action, and, if invalid, asking for a valid action\r\n3. Formatting the action into the correct format\r\n4. Checking the format, and, if invalid, asking for the properly formatted action\r\n\r\nIt's been pretty useful in making sure that the agents in these ABSs are producing good feedback without having to resort to writing more deterministic return format validators or try-except blocks.

Finally, it allows for more reliable and deterministic integration tests by ensuring that HTTP interactions are always replayed with the same response. \r\nOverall, `pytest-vcr` is a valuable tool for simplifying integration test setup and improving their reliability\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the `pytest-vcr` package as a dependency for integration tests in the `pyproject.toml` file. It also introduces two new fixtures in `tests/integration_tests/conftest.py` files for managing cassette directories and VCR configurations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the `tests/integration_tests/vectorstores/test_elasticsearch.py` file has been updated to use the `@pytest.mark.vcr` decorator for recording and replaying HTTP interactions. \r\n\r\nFinally, this commit removes the `documents` fixture from the `test_elasticsearch.py` file and replaces it with a new fixture defined in `tests/integration_tests/vectorstores/conftest.py` that yields a list of documents to use in any other tests.\r\n\r\nThis also includes my second attempt to fix issue : https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/2386\r\n\r\nMaybe related https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/2484",

        "body": "`AgentExecutor` already has support for limiting the number of iterations.  But the amount of time taken for each iteration can vary quite a bit, so it is difficult to place limits on the execution time.  This PR adds a new field `max_execution_time` to the `AgentExecutor` model.  When called asynchronously, the agent loop is wrapped in an `asyncio.timeout()` context which triggers the early stopping response if the time limit is reached.  When called synchronously, the agent loop checks for both the max_iteration limit and the time limit after each iteration.\r\n\r\nWhen used asynchronously `max_execution_time` gives really tight control over the max time for an execution chain.  When used synchronously, the chain can unfortunately exceed max_execution_time, but it still gives more control than trying to estimate the number of max_iterations needed to cap the execution time.",

By default, Entities will expire from memory after 24 hours, but they'll be persisted for another 3 days every time they're recalled. The idea is to give the AIs a bit of a spaced-repetition memory, but I have yet to see if this is useful. The memory is partitioned by `session_id` (user ID? chat channel? whatever, really) so entities from one user don't leak to another.\r\n\r\nWhile developing this, I did notice that the Entity summaries are kind of buggy (they summarize AI-generated content and not just information the human gave them, sometimes they add things like \"No new information provided. Existing summary remains: As stated previously, X\", etc.), but I'll tackle that later. First I wanted to get some input on this idea.",

        "body": "Adding the `_acall` function to `SimpleSequentialChain`, `SequentialChain`, and `TransformChain` classes is a valuable enhancement for a couple reasons:\r\n\r\nAsynchronous support: By incorporating the `_acall` method, the implementation now allows for asynchronous calls to be executed within the chain. This can help to improve performance.\r\n\r\nIntegration with `AsyncCallbackManager`: The addition of `_acall` opens the door for using `AsyncCallbackManager`, which is capable of streaming LLM outputs. This can lead to more efficient and responsive systems by allowing data to be processed as soon as it is available.\r\n\r\nCompatibility preservation: Despite the change (implementation) of the `_acall` method, the changes will not break compatibility with existing code. The synchronous _call method is still available and can be used interchangeably with the new asynchronous implementation. This may only make previously broken code work.\r\n\r\nLastly, I added the check for transform to see if a function is async since not all transform may be async, but it is still nice to be able to call `_acall` on Sequential Chain using transform chains.\r\n\r\nNote: I do not have much experience with `asyncio` but needed some type of method to stream responses while using transform and sequential chains. So, open to feedback.",

There are tutorials in the Quickstart guide among others that will throw warnings based on recent updates. This should help with that. \r\n\r\n**Note: I am not very experienced with contributing and pull requests but I did read the document about contributing and hope I did everything right. I know this is a small change but hopefully, if I get this right I can work on larger changes in the future. Please feel free to help me improve or remedy any mistakes I make.**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Change Steps**\r\n1. To allow the function to accept both **`BaseLLM`** and **`BaseChatModel`** classes, you can use Python's typing module to define a **`Union`** type hint. Here's how you can update the function signature:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Any, Optional, Sequence, Union\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Next, update the type hint for the **`llm`** parameter in the function signature to accept both classes:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef initialize_agent(\r\n    tools: Sequence[BaseTool],\r\n    llm: Union[BaseLLM, BaseChatModel],\r\n    agent: Optional[str] = None,\r\n    callback_manager: Optional[BaseCallbackManager] = None,\r\n    agent_path: Optional[str] = None,\r\n    agent_kwargs: Optional[dict] = None,\r\n    **kwargs: Any,\r\n) -> AgentExecutor:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Outcome**\r\n\r\nNow, the function accepts both **`BaseLLM`** and **`BaseChatModel`** instances without raising warnings for the **`llm`** parameter.",

The class is designed to be flexible and easy to use, allowing users to switch between different AI21 models by simply providing the model name as an argument.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses issue #85 and provides an alternative to the existing OpenAI-based text embeddings.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further changes.",

And async is very useful.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, the difference between `call/acall`, `predict/apredict` and `generate/agenerate` isn't entirely\r\nclear to me other than they all call into the LLM in slightly different ways.\r\n\r\nIs there some documentation or a good way to think about these differences?\r\n\r\nOne thought:  \r\n\r\noutput parsers should just work magically for all those LLM calls.  If the `output_parser` arg is set on the prompt, the LLM has access, so it seems like extra work on the user's end to have to call `output_parser.parse`\r\n\r\nIf this sounds reasonable, happy to throw something together. @hwchase17",

        "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a standard interface for LLM providers as proposed in #1797. This interface intends to **take the guesswork out of using models via LangChain**. \r\n\r\n- All LLM providers now accept their model ID via the `model_id` kwarg. No more guessing between `model`, `model_name`, `model_id`, `model_key`, or having to reference documentation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhf = HuggingFaceHub(model_id=\"google/flan-t5-xxl\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Furthermore, providers now directly expose the list of models they support via a class attribute. No more need to read the provider implementation, determine what upstream API is being called, and then referencing the upstream API docs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from langchain.llms import OpenAI\r\n>>> OpenAI.models\r\n['text-davinci-003', 'text-davinci-002', 'text-curie-001', 'text-babbage-001', 'text-ada-001', 'davinci', 'curie', 'babbage', 'ada']\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Some providers don\u2019t have a static, well-defined list of models available. For example, in HuggingFaceHub, new models are being uploaded daily. We call these providers **registry providers**, as they mimic the behavior of a package registry. In this case, the list of models is the wildcard specifier:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceHub\r\n>>> HuggingFaceHub.models\r\n['*']\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The standard interface also allows users to do the following **prior to provider instantiation**:\r\n    - Get provider ID by querying `LLM.id`\r\n    - Get list of package dependencies by querying `LLM.pypi_package_deps`\r\n    - Get required authentication by querying `LLM.auth_strategy`, dispatching on `LLM.auth_strategy.type`.\r\n        - For example, a developer determining if some authentication is required would first query `LLM.auth_strategy`. If it\u2019s not `None`, query `LLM.auth_strategy.type`. If this is equal to `\"env\"`, then the required environment variable is under `LLM.auth_strategy.name`.\r\n        - This can then be used to consolidate the auth validation logic into a single method on the base class, e.g. `BaseLLM#validate_auth()`.\r\n\r\nThis is how the interface is declared on `BaseLanguageModel`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass BaseLanguageModel(BaseModel, ABC):\r\n    id: ClassVar[str]\r\n    \"\"\"Unique ID for this provider class.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    model_id: str\r\n    \"\"\"Model ID to invoke by this provider via generate/agenerate.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    models: ClassVar[List[str]]\r\n    \"\"\"List of supported models by their IDs. For registry providers, this will\r\n    be just [\"*\"].\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    pypi_package_deps: ClassVar[List[str]] = []\r\n    \"\"\"List of PyPi package dependencies.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    auth_strategy: ClassVar[AuthStrategy] = None\r\n    \"\"\"Authentication/authorization strategy. Declares what credentials are\r\n    required to use this model provider. Generally should not be `None`.\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Other changes\r\n\r\n- Removes `_llm_type` property in favor of `id`\r\n- Edits most existing documentation to use new provider interface\r\n    - Not yet implemented for `azure_openai_example.ipynb` and `manifest.ipynb`\r\n- Corrects `AlephAlpha` provider ID from `alpeh_alpha` to `aleph_alpha`\r\n- Removes duplicate definitions of `FakeLLM` and `FakeListLLM` providers used in tests\r\n\r\n# Related issues\r\n\r\n- Closes #1797\r\n\r\n# Next steps\r\n\r\n- Review and iterate on this PR. I need some help with doing local integration testing, as I don't have all the API keys available to me as of yet.\r\n- Ensure we inform users of this change as much as possible, as it is a large breaking interface change for most providers. (changelog, blog post, Twitter?)\r\n- Decide what to do with `langchain.llms.manifest`\r\n    - The Manifest provider isn\u2019t really describable via this interface because it is a \u201cprovider of providers\u201d, and different models and auth strategies exist depending on the value of `client_name`, e.g. `\"openai\"` or `\"cohere\"`.\r\n    - Manifest duplicates a lot of the work LangChain does. All of its sub-providers are already implemented in LangChain. **Hence, I think we should remove this provider, as all of its functionality is already available in LangChain today.**\r\n- Consolidate auth validation logic into some base class\r\n- Implement this interface for embeddings\r\n- Update `azure_openai_example.ipynb` and `manifest.ipynb`",

        "body": "**Arize CallBack Handler for LangChain <> Arize Integration**\r\nThis pull request adds a new Python class, ArizeCallbackHandler, which serves as a callback handler that logs data into an ML Observability platform named Arize whenever a Langchain Language Model (LLM) runs within Langchain. Specifically, it logs prompt and response pairs along with their embeddings for monitoring and further finetuning.\r\n\r\nThe ArizeCallbackHandler class is implemented as a subclass of BaseCallbackHandler and contains the following methods for handling different events triggered during the LLM execution:\r\n\r\non_llm_start: records the prompts when an LLM starts\r\non_llm_end: logs data to Arize when an LLM ends, including prompt, response embeddings, id and timestamp\r\n\r\nThe constructor of ArizeCallbackHandler takes four optional arguments (Needed for logging into Arize):\r\n\r\n- model_id: the ID of the model in Arize (default: None)\r\n- model_version: the version of the model in Arize (default: None)\r\n- SPACE_KEY: the space key for the Arize client (default: None)\r\n- API_KEY: the API key for the Arize client (default: None)\r\n\r\nWhen ArizeCallbackHandler is instantiated, it initializes empty lists to store the prompt/response pairs and other necessary data. It also creates an embedding generator for generating embeddings from prompts and responses. For embeddings consistency and ease of use, Arize's embedding generator is used. Finally, it creates an Arize client and checks if the SPACE_KEY and API_KEY are set with the correct value. \r\n\r\n**Motivation and Context**\r\nThe purpose of this pull request is to provide a way to log data into Arize whenever an LLM runs within Langchain. This will allow us to monitor the performance of the LLM and make further fine-tuning to the model if necessary. As Arize develops LLM-supporting capabilities, some minor changes might be necessary in the future. \r\n\r\n**How Has This Been Tested?**\r\nI have tested this code by using weights and biases test cases with LLMs, LLM chains, and LLM agents. I checked if the prompt/response pairs and their embeddings were logged into Arize correctly. I have also tested this code with different model IDs and model versions in Arize to ensure that the data was logged to the correct model.\r\n\r\nAn example test is provided below: \r\n```\r\nfrom langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler\r\nfrom langchain.callbacks.base import CallbackManager\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\r\n\r\narize_callback = ArizeCallbackHandler(\r\n    model_id=\"llm-langchain-demo\",\r\n    model_version=\"1.0\",\r\n    SPACE_KEY=\"88aa7af\",\r\n    API_KEY=\"7cab3a79306ef1cd9e7\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nmanager = CallbackManager([StdOutCallbackHandler(), arize_callback])\r\n\r\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0, callback_manager=manager, verbose=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```llm_result = llm.generate([\"Tell me a joke\",\"Tell me a poem\"])```",

Get your api key and set it as an environment variable (`REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`)\r\n- Install the [Replicate python client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python) with `pip install replicate`\r\n\r\n## Calling a model\r\n\r\nFind a model on the [replicate explore page](https://replicate.com/explore), and then paste in the model name and version in this format: model_name/version\r\n\r\nFor example, for this [flan-t5 model]( https://replicate.com/daanelson/flan-t5), click on the API tab. The model name/version would be: `daanelson/flan-t5:04e422a9b85baed86a4f24981d7f9953e20c5fd82f6103b74ebc431588e1cec8`\r\n\r\nOnly the `model` param is required, but we can add other model params when initializing.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we were running stable diffusion and wanted to change the image dimensions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReplicate(model=\"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf\",\r\n          image_dimensions='512x512')\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note that only the first output of a model will be returned.*\r\n\r\nFrom here, we can initialize our model:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nllm = Replicate(model=\"daanelson/flan-t5:04e422a9b85baed86a4f24981d7f9953e20c5fd82f6103b74ebc431588e1cec8\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprompt = \"\"\"\r\nAnswer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step.\r\nCan a dog drive a car?\r\n\"\"\"\r\nllm(prompt)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can call any replicate model (not just LLMs) using this syntax. For example, we can call stable diffusion:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext2image = Replicate(model=\"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf\",\r\n                       image_dimensions='512x512'\r\n\r\nimage_output = text2image(\"A cat riding a motorcycle by Picasso\")\r\nimage_output\r\n```\r\n",

BaseChatModel's `__call__` calls ChatOpenAI's `_generate`\r\n1. #1785 ensures token_usage is returned by `_generate`. However, there is no `on_llm_end()` callback to expose token_usage in the `__call__`\r\n1. Adding `on_llm_callback()` just prior to returning from `__call__` solves the issue and successfully exposes `token_usage` but results in a whole bunch of linting errors since the response type is now ChatResult and not LLMResult that `on_llm_callback` is expecting.\r\n1. The PR currently implements the above point and has linting errors that I can go ahead and fix if this direction is valid. Or is there a better place to add the `on_llm_callback()` to expose token_usage for ChatOpenAI? Please let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nCurrent master returns 0 for token_usage:\r\n```\r\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback\r\nfrom langchain.schema import HumanMessage\r\n\r\nchat = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0.8)\r\n\r\nwith get_openai_callback() as cb:\r\n    response = chat([HumanMessage(content=\"Tell me a joke\")])\r\n    print(cb.total_tokens)\r\n```\r\n0\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue, and the same code prints: 25\r\n",

I suspect that it\u2019s because the prompt allows the model to generate the answer bypassing python code altogether [here](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/df8702fead4a26263f8a3f0a6fc36db1a8c37c7b/langchain/chains/llm_math/prompt.py#L19), and it can occasionally hallucinate an answer. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a simplified version of the prompt. The new version improves the behavior in the following ways:\r\n- more robust to the variations in the input format (literal values / spelled out values / whitespacing, etc)\r\n- smaller prompt size -> cheaper queries\r\n\r\n**CAUTION**\u26a0\ufe0f: both the new and the old prompts suffer from injection attacks and are quite dangerous since both are executing Python code blindly.

Instead, being able to swap `\"source\"` for `\"url\"`, `\"filename\"`, etc seems like a better solution to me.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'd like to add a new method to prompt templates called `rename_variable`, which simply takes an existing variable and a new variable name as input, and formats the prompt template to use the new variable name.\r\n\r\nIn the example of using `VectorDBQAWithSourcesChain`, this looks like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nqa = VectorDBQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(\r\n    llm=llm,\r\n    chain_type='stuff',\r\n    vectorstore=vectorstore\r\n)\r\n\r\nqa.combine_documents_chain.document_prompt.rename_variable(\r\n    'source', 'pdf_url'\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if we view the `qa.combine_documents_chain.document_prompt` we'll see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPromptTemplate(input_variables=['page_content', 'pdf_url'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template='Content: {page_content}\\nSource: {pdf_url}', template_format='f-string', validate_template=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I added a `sources_variable` parameter to the initialization calls for `VectorDBQAWithSourcesChain`, so the following can be run with the same result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nqa = VectorDBQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(\r\n    llm=llm,\r\n    chain_type='stuff',\r\n    vectorstore=vectorstore,\r\n    sources_variable=\"pdf_url\"\r\n)\r\n```",

        "body": "Similarly to how sequential chains connect chains in series, I thought we could have `ParallelChain`s connect chains in parallel. This is a useful abstraction when you want to independently process the same input with multiple different chains, possibly asynchronously. \r\n\r\nThis was largely inspired by the `ConcatenateChain` example [here](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/chains/getting_started.html#create-a-custom-chain-with-the-chain-class), although I thought that it would be good to have a generic class for handling multiple chains in parallel, to make nested composition easier. The larger intent is to compose chains similar to how `nn.Sequential` and `nn.Parallel` allowed for composing neural modules in series and in parallel in Torch7.\r\n\r\nHere is an example (which is added to the docs)\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\r\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain, SimpleParallelChain\r\n\r\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)\r\n\r\nprompt_1 = PromptTemplate(\r\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\r\n    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?\",\r\n)\r\nchain_1 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_1)\r\n\r\nprompt_2 = PromptTemplate(\r\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\r\n    template=\"What is a good slogan for a company that makes {product}?\",\r\n)\r\nchain_2 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_2)\r\n\r\nparallel_chain = SimpleParallelChain(\r\n    chains=[chain_1, chain_2],\r\n    input_variables=['product'],\r\n    output_variables=['name', 'slogan'],\r\n    verbose=True\r\n)\r\noutput = parallel_chain(\"colorful socks\")\r\nprint(f\"Output:\\n{output}\")\r\n```\r\nwhich produces the output:\r\n```\r\n> Entering new SimpleParallelChain chain...\r\n\r\n> Finished chain.\r\nOutput:\r\n{'product': 'colorful socks', 'name': '\\n\\nLively Sockery.', 'slogan': '\\n\\n\"Step Into Color with Our Socks!\"'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf having a class like this would be useful, there a few design choices I'd love to discuss: \r\n1. Would it make more sense to have all the chains define their own input variables manually, or should we let the parallel chain define the input variables once and propagate that to all the child chains? An argument for the former would be that it follows the existing convention I've seen in defining chains so far. An argument for the latter would be that it would allow the user to define the input variables to the entire parallel block in one place (which would make the ParallelChain abstraction more powerful), without having to copy the same input variables for all child chains.\r\n2. Any thoughts on whether it makes sense for this to be refactored in as a subcomponent of the MapReduceChain? The main reason for replacing the map component of the mapreduce by a ParallelChain would be that users can use ParallelChain for use cases other than applying the same llm for reducing a set of documents with the same prompt - they would instead be able to use multiple chains with different prompts each.\r\n3. Any thoughts on how we would want to support multiple outputs for each child chain, i.e. how we would want to format the output of the ParallelChain? One possibility is to do a nested dict, like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    'output_for_chain_1: {'chain_1_output_1': str, 'chain_1_output_2': str, ... },\r\n    'output_for_chain_2: {'chain_2_output_1': str, 'chain_2_output_2': str, ... },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor flatten the keys with a delimiter, like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    'output_for_chain_1/chain_1_output_1': str, 'output_for_chain_1/chain_1_output_2': str, ... },\r\n    'output_for_chain_2/chain_2_output_1': str, 'output_for_chain_2/chain_2_output_2': str, ... },\r\n}\r\n```",

However, this approach loses the role information when saving memories externally.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_buffer_string(\r\n    messages: List[BaseMessage], human_prefix: str = \"Human\", ai_prefix: str = \"AI\"\r\n) -> str:\r\n    \"\"\"Get buffer string of messages.\"\"\"\r\n    string_messages = []\r\n    for m in messages:\r\n        if isinstance(m, HumanMessage):\r\n            role = human_prefix\r\n        elif isinstance(m, AIMessage):\r\n            role = ai_prefix\r\n        elif isinstance(m, SystemMessage):\r\n            role = \"System\"\r\n        elif isinstance(m, ChatMessage):\r\n            role = m.role\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nMake HumanMessage, AIMessage, and SystemMessage inherit from ChatMessage so that the role can be passed as a parameter. Modify get_buffer_string to use the role information instead of the instance type.\r\n\r\nThe solution allows us to pass the role information when saving memories externally. Using the role parameter in get_buffer_string prevents the loss of role information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nThis change affects the inheritance hierarchy of the message classes and the get_buffer_string function. But, existing unit tests and a new test are all passed.",

Kept the old callback around for bw-compat, but it might be worth biting the bullet and removing it altogether/just naming the new one `on_llm_start`.\r\n\r\nOpen problems:\r\n* This works for most cases since `LLMChain` is wired up to use `generate_prompt/agenerate_prompt`. However, the callback won't be triggered if people are using `generate` or `__call__` -- need to figure out a workaround for that.\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-09 at 9 44 12 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9536492/224234401-86df7b91-0e05-4a16-b315-8848dce27a6a.png)\r\n\r\n",

So the LLM is seeing the `LIMIT` statement used in the prompt. \r\nSince we can't specify each dialect's method here, I think it's fine to just replace the `SELECT... LIMIT 3;` statement with `3 rows from table_name table:`, and wrap everything in a block comment directly following the `CREATE` statement. The Rajkumar et al paper wrapped the example rows and `SELECT` statement in a block comment as well anyway.\r\nThoughts @fpingham?",

        "body": "## Description\r\nThis PR adds a Weights & Biases callback to Langchain, which will allow users to easily track the generations of their interaction with LangChain. \r\n\r\n- During the duration of the session with Langchain, callback users have the option to log each action performed by the Module to Weights & Biases, alongside the opportunity to analyze the text using complexity metrics such as Flesch-Kincaid, or an option to visualize the text's structure such as Entity Recognition. Details of stdout are automatically saved to the Weights and Biases platform during the context of the callback.\r\n- At the end of a session with a module, the generations are logged to Weights and Biases, alongside any selected metrics and visualizations. Users have the ability to also log a table containing all the available information for each callback action that was received, similar to a trace.\r\n\r\nAs there is no formal finish signal to emit depending on the Langchain Module used to provide generations, we treat the usage of these LLMs similar to a user-defined session, where each session is used to collect many generations for a prompt, test out many different prompts, or different configurations for an LLM.\r\n- To serialize the contents of a Langchain module alongside the aforementioned tables to create a contextually tracked model artifact, we add a function to the `WandbCallback` called `flush_tracker` which when provided the langchain module to serialize, and some flags controlling the next state of the model for your sessions, will log the aforementioned artifact to Weights and Biases.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n- Added `wandb`, `textstat`, `spacy en-core-web-sm` (3.5.0) and `pandas` packages to `pyproject.toml`\r\n- Created a new `WandbCallback` class in `wandb_callback.py` in `langchain/callbacks`\r\n- Exposed this new callback class in the `langchain/callbacks/__.init__.py`\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any issues or concerns with this PR. Thank you for your time and consideration!\r\n\r\n## Recreating Validation\r\nAn example script showing 3 different scenarios using Langchain modules with the `WandbCallback` have been provided in this colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DXH4beT4HFaRKy_Vm4PoxhXVDRf7Ym8L?usp=sharing\r\nAn example workspace can be found here: https://wandb.ai/a-sh0ts/langchain_callback_demo?workspace=user-a-sh0ts\r\n- Under `minimal_*` it will show the default workspace which will only log during flush, but still track generations and actions during the session.\r\n    - To recreate the above `minimal` workspace you can run the collar fully as is\r\n- Under `full_*` it will show the maximal workspace with the tracked values during the session, and the expanded generations table with analysis and visualizations\r\n    - To recreate features of the above `full` workspace, set all the appropriate flags to `True` in the callback of the `WandbCallbackHandler`\r\n\r\n## Defaults\r\nDefault values for WandbCallbackHandler(...):\r\n```\r\nvisualize: bool = False,\r\ncomplexity_metrics: bool = False,\r\nstream_logs: bool = False,\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefaults for WandbCallbackHandler.flush_tracker(...):\r\n```\r\nreset: bool = True,\r\nfinish: bool = False,\r\n```\r\n",

        "body": "Currently, table information is gathered through SQLAlchemy as complete table DDL and a user-selected number of sample rows from each table. This PR adds the option to use user-defined table information instead of automatically collecting it. This will use the provided table information and fall back to the automatic gathering for tables that the user didn't provide information for.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, there are a few cases where this can be quite useful:\r\n- The first n rows of a table are uninformative, or very similar to one another. In this case, hand-crafting example rows for a table such that they provide the good, diverse information can be very helpful. Another approach we can think about later is getting a random sample of n rows instead of the first n rows, but there are some performance considerations that need to be taken there. Even so, hand-crafting the sample rows is useful and can guarantee the model sees informative data.\r\n- The user doesn't want every column to be available to the model. This is not an elegant way to fulfill this specific need since the user would have to provide the table definition instead of a simple list of columns to include or ignore, but it does work for this purpose. \r\n- For the developers, this makes it a lot easier to compare/benchmark the performance of different prompting structures for providing table information in the prompt.\r\n\r\nThese are cases I've run into myself (particularly cases 1 and 3) and I've found these changes useful. Personally, I keep custom table info for a few tables in a yaml file for versioning and easy loading.\r\n\r\nDefinitely open to other opinions/approaches though!",

        "body": "The current prompt specifically instructs the LLM to use the `LIMIT` clause. This will cause issues with MS SQL Server, which uses `SELECT TOP` instead of `LIMIT`. The generated SQL will use `LIMIT`; the instruction to \"always limit... using the LIMIT clause\" seems to override the \"create a syntactically correct mssql query to run\" portion. Reported here: https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/issues/1103#issuecomment-1441144224\r\n\r\nI don't have access to a SQL Server instance to test, but removing that part of the prompt in OpenAI Playground results in the correct `SELECT TOP` syntax, whereas keeping it in results in the `LIMIT` clause, even when instructing it to generate syntactically correct mssql. It's also still correctly using `LIMIT` in my MariaDB database. I think in this case we can assume that the model will select the appropriate method based on the dialect specified.\r\n\r\nIn general, it would be nice to be able to test a suite of SQL dialects for things like dialect-specific syntax and other issues we've run into in the past, but I'm not quite sure how to best approach that yet.",

        "body": "Inspired by the `LLMCheckerChain`, which is very useful for checking questions and answers, I found a need to check\r\nif the assertions made in a summarization of unknown texts was factually accurate.\r\n\r\n`LLMSummarizationCheckerChain` follows the pattern of `LLMCheckerChain` and [Fact Checker](https://github.com/jagilley/fact-checker), but builds on it by\r\nconditionally double/triple/n-checking the regeneration of the \"correct\" summary text.   The `llm_summarization_checker.ipynb` notebook shows a few examples of different\r\ntypes of text, and the output.  \r\n\r\nOther small changes\r\n- Changed `Prompt.from_file` to allow relative to the caller file paths.\r\n- Added some more context to one of the prompt parameter checks after spending way too long trying to figure out why it was throwing that exception\r\n- Added memory support to sequential chains by fixing the param validation\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### More details\r\n\r\nIt does a very good job most of the time, but as always with these models, it tends to hallucinate and gets confused.  If `max_checks` is set too high,\r\nand the LLM temperature is high, it can get stuck in an infinite loop, hallucinating itself to madness.  On the other hand, if you like to live on the edge, you can set `max_checks` to one and have it behave\r\nlike any other `SequentialChain`.\r\n\r\nDepending on the dataset and type of application, I've found through experimenting with it that the LLM temperature is extremely important.  Keeping it at 0 has yielded the most consistent results, but some unstructured\r\ntexts require a little more variety to get somewhere good.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it really does have problems with more nuanced facts.  For example, \"Mammals can lay eggs, birds can lay eggs, therefore birds are mammals.\".  It has no problem correctly identifying that \"Birds are mammals\" is false.\r\nBut the statement \"Mammals can lay eggs\" is technically true - see Platypus' (Nature is weird).  The chain gets to a factually correct end point \"'Birds can lay eggs and are not mammals; they belong to a distinct class of their own, separate from mammals.'\"\r\nbut along the way, it incorrectly asserted \"Mammals can lay eggs: False. Mammals are not capable of laying eggs, as they give birth to live young.\".\r\n\r\nIt gets to the right answer, but in a long and round-a-bout way.\r\n\r\nOther strange prompt observations:\r\n- Using the word \"Fact\" instead of \"Assertion\" improved the accuracy of the checked_facts generation.\r\n- Pre-prompting with \"Fact-checking reporter\" persona also improved accuracy.\r\n- Adding a third \"Undetermined\" option when classifying true/false had the largest impact on the final output.  It seems like giving the LLM an \"out\" if it wasn't confident in the answer prevented some hallucinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully this is useful to someone - there's a lot more you can do down this path like abandoning the check loop after a certain number of tries and firing off a chain that does a SERP scrape or docstore lookup to get context and try again. \r\n",

This limits the usability of the library to fetch a more comprehensive search result list. Additionally, the library does not support the currency converter feature available in some search engine results pages.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\nBefore it would scrape:\r\n```\r\nBitcoin USD price, real-time (live) charts, news and videos. Learn about BTC value, bitcoin cryptocurrency, crypto trading, and more.\r\nThe live price of Bitcoin is $ 24,475.15 per (BTC / USD) today with a current market cap of $ 472.29B USD. 24-hour trading volume is $ 28.68B USD.\r\nFebruary 20, 2023 - The current price of Bitcoin is $24605.78 per (BTC / USD).

The returned search results are then concatenated to form a single string.\r\n\r\nUpdate snippet extraction code to handle multiple search results: With the updated `num` parameter, the library extracts all search results' snippets instead of just the first one. This is done by looping through all the search results and concatenating the snippets.\r\n\r\nAdd support for currency converter: The library is updated to support currency conversion results available in some search engines. The currency converter result is appended to the end of the snippet string, along with the currency symbol.",

        "body": "New modules to facilitate easy use of embedding and LLM models on one's own cloud GPUs. Uses [Runhouse](https://github.com/run-house/runhouse) to facilitate cloud RPC. Supports AWS, GCP, Azure, and Lambda today (auto-launching) and BYO hardware by IP and SSH creds (e.g. for on-prem or other clouds like Coreweave, Paperspace, etc.).\r\n\r\n**APIs**\r\nThe API mirrors the HuggingFaceEmbedding and HuggingFaceInstructEmbedding, but accepts an additional \"hardware\" parameter:\r\n```\r\nfrom langchain.embeddings import SelfHostedHuggingFaceEmbeddings, SelfHostedHuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings\r\nimport runhouse as rh\r\ngpu = rh.cluster(name=\"rh-a10x\", instance_type=\"A100:1\")\r\nhf = SelfHostedHuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\", hardware=gpu)\r\n\r\n# Will run on the same GPU\r\nhf_instruct = SelfHostedHuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings(model_name=\"hkunlp/instructor-large\", hardware=gpu)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rh.cluster above will launch the A100 on GCP, Azure, or Lambda, whichever is enabled and cheapest (thanks to SkyPilot). You can specify a specific provider by `provider='gcp'`, as well as `use_spot`, `region`, `image_id`, and `autostop_mins`. For AWS you'd need to just switch to \"A10G:1\". For BYO cluster, you can do:\r\n```\r\ngpu = rh.cluster(ips=['<ip of the cluster>'], \r\n                             ssh_creds={'ssh_user': '...', 'ssh_private_key':'<path_to_key>'},\r\n                             name='rh-a10x')\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Design**\r\nAll we're doing here is sending a pre-defined inference function to the cluster through Runhouse, which brings up the cluster if needed, installs the dependencies, and returns a callable that sends requests to run the function over gRPC. The function takes the model_id as an input, but the model is cached so only needs to be downloaded once. We can improve performance further pretty easily by pinning the model to GPU memory on the cluster. Let me know if that's of interest.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nAdded new tests embeddings/test_self_hosted.py (which mirror test_huggingface.py) and llms/test_self_hosted_llm.py. Tests all pass on Lambda Labs (which is surprising, because the first two test_huggingface.py tests are supposedly segfaulting?). We can pin the provider used in the test to whichever is used by your CI, or you can choose to only run these on a schedule to avoid spinning up a GPU (can take ~5 minutes including installations).\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce SelfHostedPipeline and SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM\r\n- [x] Introduce SelfHostedEmbedding, SelfHostedHuggingFaceEmbedding, and SelfHostedHuggingFaceInstructEmbedding\r\n- [x] Add tutorials for Self-hosted LLMs and Embeddings\r\n- [x] Implement chat-your-data tutorial with Self-hosted models - https://github.com/dongreenberg/chat-your-data",

This decorator can be used to quickly create a `Tool` from a simple function. The decorator uses the function name as the tool name by default, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. Additionally, the decorator will use the function's docstring as the tool's description.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.agents import tool\r\n\r\n\r\n@tool\r\ndef search_api(query: str) -> str:\r\n    \"\"\"Searches the API for the query.\"\"\"\r\n    return \"Results\"\r\n\r\n\r\n@tool(\"search\", return_direct=True)\r\ndef search_api(query: str) -> str:\r\n    \"\"\"Searches the API for the query.\"\"\"\r\n    return \"Results\"\r\n\r\ntools = [search_api]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you inspect the function, you'll see that it's a `Tool` instance instead of some additional information in the description, this tool can still be called as if it was a function so it won't interview with users' expectations of their function being callable.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nprint(search_api)\r\n# Tool(name='search_api', func=<function search_api at 0x10fd7cd30>, description='search_api(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.', return_direct=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Comments:\r\n1. I noticed that 3 lint errors come up since it's having a hard time figuring out the type of `@tool(\"name\")` it thinks it's a tool when it should be callable. Not sure if my annotations are incorrect \r\n2. I considered adding more explicit checks like \"function only has one argument, and returns str\". but decided not to since others might extend the functionality.",

It does not test for behavior beyond that.\r\n\r\nWe add a dependency [nbmake](https://github.com/treebeardtech/nbmake), which was designed for this purpose. Another option is to use [nbclient](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclient), which is already included in dependencies. I added an example here: https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/compare/master...ccurme:langchain:cc/test_notebooks_nbclient.

Since the logger is not formatted, the statement itself is output like a print statement, and I thought it was difficult to understand that it was a warning, so I put WARNING! at the beginning of the warning statement. After the logger formatting is done properly, the word WARNING can be repeated.\r\n2. Statement `Please confirm that {field_name} is what you intended.` can be replaced like `If {field_name} is intended parameters, enter it to model_kwargs`\r\nthank you!\r\n\r\nYongtae",

Right now it just outputs a paragraph in a new Notion page inside a database\r\n\r\nFuture improvements:\r\n- Add read functionality\r\n- [Insert your ideas]\r\n\r\n- How to use it:\r\nYou should have the notion-client  python package installed, and the environment variable ``NOTION_TOKEN`` AND ``NOTION_DATABASE_ID`` set, or pass `notion_token` as a named parameter to the constructor.\r\n\r\nTo get your token:\r\n\r\n1- Go to Notion, create a new integration and save the integration secret to NOTION_TOKEN\r\n2- Create a new database in notion and copy its ID to NOTION_DATABASE_ID.\r\nThe id is normally the last part of the URL when you have a database open.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Example of a prompt working with an Agent: \"Save the output of X in Notion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love yall help with this one! :)",

        "body": "Big docs refactor! Motivation is to make it easier for people to find resources they are looking for. To accomplish this, there are now three main sections:\r\n\r\n- Getting Started: steps for getting started, walking through most core functionality\r\n- Modules: these are different modules of functionality that langchain provides. Each part here has a \"getting started\", \"how to\", \"key concepts\" and \"reference\" section (except in a few select cases where it didnt easily fit). \r\n- Use Cases: this is to separate use cases (like summarization, question answering, evaluation, etc) from the modules, and provide a different entry point to the code base.\r\n\r\nThere is also a full reference section, as well as extra resources (glossary, gallery, etc)",

I kept around the verbosity flag. 1) this is pretty important for getting the stdout to look good for agents (and other things). 2) I actually added this for LLM class since it didn't have it.\r\n\r\n3. The only part that isn't basically perfectly moved over is the end of the agent run. Here's a screenshot of the new stdout tracing\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-29 at 4 03 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11986836/210011538-6a74551a-2e61-437b-98d3-674212dede56.png)\r\n\r\nNoticing it is missing logging of the final thought, eg before this is what it looked like\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-29 at 4 13 07 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11986836/210011635-de68b3f5-e2b0-4cd3-9f1a-3afe970a8716.png)\r\n\r\nThe reason its missing is that this was previously logged as part of agent end (lines 205 and 206)\r\n\r\nthis is probably only relevant for the std out logger? any thoughts for how to get it back in?\r\n",

Install google-api-python-client\r\n    - If you don't already have a Google account, sign up.\r\n    - If you have never created a Google APIs Console project,\r\n    read the Managing Projects page and create a project in the Google API Console.\r\n    - Install the library using `pip install google-api-python-client`\r\n    The current version of the library is 2.70.0 at this time\r\n\r\n    2. To create an API key:\r\n    - Navigate to the APIs & Services\u2192Credentials panel in Cloud Console.\r\n    - Select Create credentials, then select API key from the drop-down menu.\r\n    - The API key created dialog box displays your newly created key.\r\n    - You now have an `API_KEY`\r\n\r\n    3. Setup Custom Search Engine so you can search the entire web\r\n    - Create a custom search engine in this link.\r\n    - In Sites to search, add any valid URL (i.e. www.stackoverflow.com).\r\n    - That\u2019s all you have to fill up, the rest doesn\u2019t matter.\r\n    In the left-side menu, click Edit search engine \u2192 {your search engine name}\r\n    \u2192 Setup Set Search the entire web to ON. Remove the URL you added from\r\n     the list of Sites to search.\r\n    - Under Search engine ID you\u2019ll find the `search-engine-ID`.\r\n\r\n    4. Enable the Custom Search API\r\n    - Navigate to the APIs & Services\u2192Dashboard panel in Cloud Console.\r\n    - Click Enable APIs and Services.\r\n    - Search for Custom Search API and click on it.\r\n    - Click Enable.\r\n    URL for it: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/customsearch.googleapis\r\n    .com\r\n    Adapted from: Instructions adapated from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search\r\n\r\n- [X] Implementation\r\n- [X] Tests, Inline Docs, Formatting\r\n- [ ] Add it to `load_tools`.\r\n- [ ] Improve external documentation\r\n\r\nI think it still needs some general work here. Has been a while since I've coded in Python. I tried my best to follow the steps provided in the resources.\r\n\r\n",
