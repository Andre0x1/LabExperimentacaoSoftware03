The current default of 10 was set in PHP 11 years ago, which is no longer a suitable default.\r\n\r\n12 appears to be the sweet spot between performance and security, [as confirmed by a member of the Hashcat team](https://phpc.social/@tychotithonus@infosec.exchange/111104389164750098). [Symfony uses a cost of 13](https://github.com/symfony/password-hasher/blob/6.3/Hasher/NativePasswordHasher.php#L36C1-L37C1), however that may be too high for some servers.\r\n\r\nDue to the way hashing works, there are no backwards compatibility issues - older passwords with lower rounds will still be handled properly, and code that automatically rehashes passwords will upgrade them over time. It's also worth pointing out that since rounds are defined in `config/hashing.php`, existing projects won't automatically get the new rounds cost and thus won't have any performance impacts. [The RFC contains hash calculation timings](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023) if you'd like more information on the impacts.\r\n\r\nIncreasing rounds to 12 in `config/hashing.php` should be a recommended upgrade step for Laravel 11 (and possibly added to the guide for 10?).\r\n\r\nFramework PR: https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/48494",

With the **recent addition of NativePHP** in the Laravel ecosystem, **which compiles the build into the dist folder**, it's now generating a substantial number of files. I believe it would be beneficial to ignore these files in the .gitignore, to prevent new developers from accidentally committing them.\r\n\r\n**Currently, the dist folder is not being ignored in the .gitignore file, which causes the git logs to display a multitude of changed files. This situation can be a bit overwhelming for contributors and users alike.**\r\n\r\nTo address this, I've included the necessary entry in the .gitignore file to ignore the dist folder and its contents. By doing so, we can keep the repository cleaner and avoid any unintentional commits of build artifacts.\r\n\r\nI've thoroughly tested this modification on my forked copy, and everything is working seamlessly. While it's a small adjustment, I believe it will greatly enhance the development experience for all contributors and newcomers.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my contribution. I'm excited about the opportunity to improve this amazing open-source Laravel project, and I look forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAkash Singh",

        "body": "**This PR does NOT affect existing applications. Only new applications.**\r\n\r\nCompanion to and requires: https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/47040\r\n\r\n**Intro:** Over the years, Laravel has accumulated quite a bit of \"noise\" in its application skeleton. Middleware stubs that aren't really required. Noisy bootstrapping files. Manual event and policy registration properties when neither are technically required anymore thanks to auto discovery. Stale migration timestamps. Too many migrations in general. This PR attempts to take the skeleton back down to a slimmer foundation with a more essential set of files, providing a generally more \"light-weight\" vibe to the skeleton application.\r\n\r\n- Policies property removed from `AuthServiceProvider`. Policy auto-discovery has existed for a long time. The `$policies` property can be added back manually if desired.\r\n- The `SendEmailVerificationNotification` is now registered automatically by the base `EventServiceProvider`. It longer needs to be in the application skeleton taking up space.\r\n- Event discovery enabled by default. This is just a better developer experience.\r\n- Broadcast routes file now loaded automatically thanks to call to `withBroadcasting` in bootstrap file. BroadcastServiceProvider no longer necessary.\r\n- Guest middleware now has base definition so it just a simple `redirectTo` method.\r\n- Authenticated middleware no longer calls `redirectTo` for JSON routes at all by default. Removes an unnecessary ternary check in the application skeleton middleware.\r\n- `TrustProxies` removed from skeleton. Core version trusts all proxies by default as this is common in a modern AWS / Cloud world. Can override it if you need to.\r\n- `TrustHosts` removed from skeleton. Core version has sensible defaults. Kernel updated to use core version.\r\n- `ValidateSignature` removed from skeleton. Base version registered as middleware alias. New static `except` method can be used to add ignored parameters if you wish via your `AppServiceProvider`.\r\n- HTTP component version of `ValidatePostSize` now used by kernel.\r\n- CSRF middleware now references `ValidateCsrfToken` for naming consistency.\r\n- Sanctum configuration file updated to use `validate_csrf_token`.\r\n- Base `EncryptCookies` and `TrimStrings` middleware are now used by default. No longer needed in skeleton. Static `except` methods added to both middleware for runtime configuration in `AppServiceProvider` if needed.\r\n- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands` are now discovered by default. No need to call `load` in console kernel.\r\n- \"Console\" routes file is removed. Closure based Artisan commands can now be registered directly in the console kernel.\r\n- Removed `PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance` \u2026 use framework version directly. Secrets / tokens are more robust way to access entire site during maintenance mode.\r\n- Consolidated migrations into a single default migration. Sanctum migration already runs automatically because it exists in Sanctum package. Migration renamed to begin with `0001_...` so it is evergreen and doesn't appear \"old\".\r\n- ~~New `file` failed job storage driver is default. Removed need to have a `failed_jobs` table migration in the skeleton by default.~~\r\n- Database queued jobs table and failed jobs table are now consolidated into a single migration\r\n- `ValidateCsrfToken` removed from skeleton by default. Static `except` method added to core middleware for excluding certain URIs from CSRF verification.\r\n- Removed two traits from base controller. Validation using `$this->validate` in controllers has not been documented in some time. `$this->authorize` can simply be `Gate::authorize`.\r\n- `bootstrap/app.php` file has been greatly simplified.\r\n- Exception handler is no longer in the skeleton. All exception handling configuration can be done in application bootstrap file by calling the handler's public methods to ignore certain exceptions or customize their rendering. Or, you can use renderable and reportable exceptions.\r\n\r\n**Remaining tasks:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation updates to reflect all changes\r\n- [ ] Breeze ships an `AuthServiceProvider` stub which needs to be updated to match changes here\r\n- [ ] Jetstream publishes a new user table migration which needs to be updated to match changes here, including file name change\r\n- [ ] Fortify publishes a migration with a 2014 timestamp. It could optionally be updated to a newer timestamp but no changes are technically required",

This will enable more accurate performance tracking and debugging of slow requests.\r\n\r\n**Files modified:**\r\n- artisan\r\n- public/index.php\r\n\r\n**Further notes:**\r\nLARAVEL_HR_START stands for LARAVEL_HIGH_RESOLUTION_START. The question of whether to abbreviate or not begins with PHP's own function using the abbreviated form. I think it makes sense to abbreviate because PHP abbreviates.\r\n\r\nWe cannot replace the functionality of microtime(true) with hrtime(true), but we can include both approaches by default. hrtime(true) will greatly improve the accuracy of performance tracking, which I've found necessary in web crawling and scraping applications where optimizations are important to improve your application's capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn respect of existing applications usage of LARAVEL_START, my pull request runs LARAVEL_HR_START first to ensure LARAVEL_START is unaltered, which also makes sense since LARAVEL_HR_START can then track the full execution time of the application including the definition of LARAVEL_START. This is of course a very minor concern.",

        "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nIf there is no `ASSET_URL` for a Laravel project, Laravel will fallback to appending the current request's host. It ignores the `APP_URL`.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nAPP_URL=https://app-url.com\r\nASSET_URL=\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the site is served at `http://127.0.0.1:8008`...\r\n\r\n```php\r\nasset('style.css');\r\n\r\n// http://127.0.0.1:8000/style.css \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works great for the backend, but Vite will never know what the host of the request is, as all its knowledge must be known at build time. So Vite and Laravel can not truly share the asset URL across the build time / runtime divide _when `ASSET_URL` is empty_.\r\n\r\n**Why is this a problem?**\r\n\r\nLaravel outputs preload tags for all the required assets for the initial page load (hashes removed for readability).\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/Register.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/GuestLayout.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/TextInput.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/PrimaryButton.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/ApplicationLogo.js\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nInternally we use the `asset` helper to generate these URLs. You can see they have appended the incoming request host.\r\n\r\nWhen Vite boots and on subsequent page navigation Vite will also preload all required assets that _have not yet been seen_.\r\n\r\nVite does not know about `http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/app.css`. Vite only knows about `/build/assets/app.css`. This results in duplicate preload tags populating the document on initial page load.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/Register.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/GuestLayout.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/TextInput.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/PrimaryButton.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/assets/ApplicationLogo.js\">\r\n\r\n<!-- ... -->\r\n\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/Register.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/GuestLayout.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/TextInput.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/PrimaryButton.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" as=\"script\" href=\"/build/assets/ApplicationLogo.js\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis isn't hugely problematic, as the browser knows that both of these URLs point to the same resource, i.e. the browser doesn't try to preload 2 sets of resources. The Vite preloads are a noop in the case that Laravel has already output its own preload tags.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIf we have the `ASSET_URL` fallback to a `/` (which was not possible in `9.x` but is in `10.x`) we get uniform output from both Laravel and Vite, and thus Vite does not output duplicate tags.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/Register.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/GuestLayout.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/TextInput.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/PrimaryButton.js\">\r\n<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/build/assets/ApplicationLogo.js\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could look at changing this in the framework, but I figure doing it in the skeleton allows for ultimate control for developers if they want to restore the previous functionality of using the incoming request's host.\r\n\r\n## Not just a Vite problem\r\n\r\nAlthough this is motivated by a Vite related problem, this will benefit other and future tools. \r\n\r\nI believe that a known static value for `ASSET_URL` makes total sense as a default. The asset helper is meant to link to assets, and very often those assets are built by a 3rd party. This allows a more expected shared value across the runtime / build time divide.\r\n\r\nI also don't believe this should be problematic in anyway, because the request host and `/` should be equivalent unless you are doing something really funky.",

This includes:  **Laravel `v10.x`** skeleton, generated code by `make` commands, starter kits like breeze and jetstream, and more. Let's see some examples:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n          *\r\n          * Run the migrations.\r\n-         *\r\n-         * @return void\r\n          */\r\n-        public function up()\r\n+        public function up(): void\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n         /**\r\n          * Handle the User \"created\" event.\r\n-         *\r\n-         * @param  \\App\\Models\\User  $user\r\n-         * @return void\r\n         */\r\n-        public function created($user)\r\n+        public function created(User $user): void\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    /**\r\n     * Define the application's command schedule.\r\n     *\r\n-    * @param  \\Illuminate\\Console\\Scheduling\\Schedule  $schedule\r\n-    * @return void\r\n     */\r\n-    protected function schedule($schedule)\r\n+    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, PHP native types were added in a way that is **realistically possible** \u2014  and **without breaking changes**. In addition, we are equally proposing changes coding-style-wise. Let's see the proposed changes in detail:\r\n\r\n1. **Allow user-land types around methods arguments and return types**. Due to PHP's covariance and contravariance rules, we've typed **only arguments** on classes that exist user vendor directory, so all the cases below are possible:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass A { function foo(string $a); } // framework\r\nclass B extends A { function foo($a); } // skeleton\r\nclass C extends A { function foo($a): int; } // skeleton\r\nclass D extends A { function foo(string $a); } // skeleton\r\nclass E extends A { function foo(string $a): int ; } // skeleton\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing this reasoning, none of the changes made at framework level are breaking, and users can remove type-hints if they want.\r\n\r\n2. **Removal of superfluous PHP annotations**. So, when the native argument type or return type is exactly the same as the PHP Annotation, we can safely remove it. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    /**\r\n     * Update the specified resource in storage.\r\n-    *\r\n-    * @param  \\Illuminate\\Http\\Request  $request\r\n-    * @param  \\App\\Models\\Chirp  $chirp\r\n-    * @return \\Illuminate\\Http\\Response\r\n     */\r\n-    public function update(Request $request, Chirp $chirp)\r\n+    public function update(Request $request, Chirp $chirp): Response\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet, if the PHP annotation adds auto-completion or static analysis value, we keep it, so the user can leverage a better developer experience. In the example below, we know via the native type that the return should be an array, and via the PHP annotation that should be an array composed of string values:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    /**\r\n     * Get the host patterns that should be trusted.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return array<int, string>\r\n     */\r\n-    public function hosts()\r\n+    public function hosts(): array\r\n    {\r\n        return [\r\n            'laravel.test',\r\n        ];\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. **Allow user-land types around closures arguments**. This pull request proposes adding native typing around closures arguments, but not return types to keep the code aesthetically pretty:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    public function register(): void\r\n    {\r\n-        $this->reportable(function ($e) {\r\n+        $this->reportable(function (Throwable $e) {\r\n            //\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen convenient for the code - meaning that It's obvious that the user will always return the first line - the closures may be replaced by short closures. And here, the rules are the same, where native PHP typing only gets applied to arguments:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n    /**\r\n     * Indicate that the model's email address should be unverified.\r\n     */\r\n    public function unverified(): static\r\n    {\r\n-        return $this->state(function (array $attributes) {\r\n-            return [\r\n-                'email_verified_at' => null,\r\n-            ];\r\n-        });\r\n\r\n+        return $this->state(fn (array $attributes) => [\r\n+            'email_verified_at' => null,\r\n+        ]);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. **We are not addressing typed properties**.  While this pull request makes pretty much possible to use native typing on an entire Laravel project, our users won't be able type \"properties\" that are extended from Framework classes. E.g: Models, service providers, etc. This does not mean we are not addressing in the future, yet it does not belong to the scope of this pull request.\r\n\r\nThe rules stated above should be applied across the entire Laravel organization. And bellow, we talk about how we are doing that.",

in my `.env` file, copied straight from the `.env.example`.\r\n\r\nI've had a quick look and it seems that this field is being treated at `null` rather than `\"null\"` so it's not using the `\"null\"` logging channel (which I'm guessing is the intended channel).\r\n\r\nThe following changes seem to stop the `Unable to create configured logger.` error from being logged:\r\n\r\n- Removing the `LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL`field completely from the `.env` so that it falls back to the value set in the `config/logging.php` file.\r\n- Or, using a different channel for the `LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL`.\r\n- Or, as a weird experiment, I changed the name of the `\"null\"` channel to `\"nulll\"` in the `.env` (to stop any possible casting from `\"null\"` to `null`) and the `config/logging.php` and it seems to stop the issue.\r\n\r\nSo based on this, I wondered if it was worth removing the `LOG_DEPRECATIONS_CHANNEL` field from the `.env.example` so that other people don't trip up over it the same as I did?\r\n\r\nAs I said though, if this is just something on my end that I've not done quite right, I apologise! \ud83d\ude04",

We\u2019ve received a lot of feedback that various features of the Ably Laravel integration don\u2019t work as expected, often caused by the fact that there\u2019s a dependency on the Pusher JavaScript SDK which we have no control over. This collection of PRs adds a new broadcaster which uses the ably-js SDK which means that we can ensure that the Ably broadcaster will remain stable. We are more than happy to take feedback and answer any questions about the work presented here :)\r\n\r\nAdds example environment variables to .env.example for the new AblyBroadcaster and references them in broadcasting.php.\r\n",

        "body": "This provides a work around to an interesting problem with Signed URLs that I encountered and discussed here: https://twitter.com/valorin/status/1547053470389112834.\r\n\r\nI've created a PR for the framework here: https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/43160\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nThe problem is that some systems, such as mailing list providers and Facebook will add their own tracking parameters onto URLs. Such as the [UTM tracking parameters](https://usefathom.com/utm-builder) (`utm_*`), and Facebook's `fbclid` parameter,  which it adds to any links clicked for tracking purposes.\r\n\r\nSince these are added as query parameters, they break the signature and prevent the URL from being validated.\r\n\r\n### Solution \r\n\r\nMy solution is to replicate the design used in other core middleware (i.e. `EncryptCookies`, `PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance`, `TrimStrings`, & `VerifyCsrfToken`) and include a configurable `$ignore` parameter, which can be used to specify the query parameters to be ignored when verifying the signature.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ValidateSignature extends Middleware\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * The names of the parameters that should be ignored.\r\n     *\r\n     * @var array<int, string>\r\n     */\r\n    protected $ignore = [\r\n        'utm_campaign',\r\n        'utm_source',\r\n        'utm_medium',\r\n        'utm_content',\r\n        'utm_term',\r\n        'fbclid',\r\n    ];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions...\r\n\r\nThe big question is if common tracking query parameters should be ignored by default. \r\n\r\nSigned URL issues are hard to debug, such as when they are [shared on Facebook](https://twitter.com/warsh33p/status/1547113243616870401), so having these default ignored would be beneficial in most cases. However it would break signed URLs that legitimately include those parameters. Although the argument could be made that you'd need to update the middleware to introduce these parameters, so it shouldn't break existing signed URLs.\r\n\r\nI've defaulted them commented out for now to be safe, but enabled by default should be considered.",

        "body": "I'd like to make it easier to log to Papertrail from Vapor with the stock `logging.php` configuration. This PR discusses two approaches. The patch relates to the first and lighter approach.\r\n\r\nWith the way Vapor automatically sets up things like queues and caches, it's surprisingly difficult to get Papertrail working. After finally finding examples of getting Papertrail working with Vapor and finally getting it working myself, I wanted to see how easy I could make it to set up for other projects. Bonus points for getting Papertrail to work out of the box on Vapor with only *having* to set `PAPERTRAIL_URL` and `PAPERTRAIL_PORT`.\r\n\r\nFor Vapor specifically, there are some additional steps that need to be taken on the Papertrail side, so some additional docs specific to Vapor may still need to be written. In short, it comes down to:\r\n\r\n * Making sure TCP and TLS are enabled for the log destination\r\n * Optionally adding a log destination for each specific Vapor project to ensure logging can be separated by Vapor project since the IP address/hostnames may not be stable.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to write these docs (or at least suggest copy) if that helps. I'd actually be happy to help contribute docs to Vapor for setting up Papertrail even if nothing ultimately comes of this PR. :)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe first approach is to add a `LOG_PAPERTRAIL_HANDLER` environment variable that can be set to override the default `SyslogUdpHandler` used by the `papertrail` channel.\r\n\r\nThis patch allows someone to specify the following environment variable to send logs to Papertrail even from Laravel Vapor by just using the existing `PAPERTRAIL_URL` and `PAPERTRAIL_PORT` variables already used to configure `SyslogUdpHandler`.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by ensuring `LOG_PAPERTRAIL_HANDLER` is used if it is set and falling back to `SyslogUdpHandler` if it is not. Additionally, `handler_with` has a new entry that is a string built from the existing `PAPERTRAIL_URL` and `PAPERTRAIL_PORT` variables that represent the `connectionString` used by `SocketHandler`.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# .env\r\nLOG_PAPERTRAIL_HANDLER=Monolog\\Handler\\SocketHandler\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn theory, Vapor could automatically set `LOG_PAPERTRAIL_HANDLER=Monolog\\Handler\\SocketHandler` for projects so it is automatically configuring a supported handler out of the box.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, people can do this themselves. It's just not super obvious how to go about doing it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe second approach is to take this to a slightly higher level. Rather than juggling monolog handler definitions, we could create a Papertrail specific handler that decorates either `SyslogUdpHandler` or `SocketHandler` depending on an additional setting.\r\n\r\nThis would be a bit more work and even though I like this approach better (seems nicer, friendly, and cleaner) I didn't want to spend time on it before I knew it had a chance of getting accepted.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, I'd expect the new default Papertrail logging configuration to look something like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// config/logging.php\r\nreturn [\r\n    'channels' => [\r\n        'papertrail' => [\r\n            'driver' => 'monolog',\r\n            'level' => 'debug',\r\n            'handler' => env('LOG_PAPERTRAIL_HANDLER', PapertrailHandler::class),\r\n            'handler_with' => [\r\n                'host' => env('PAPERTRAIL_URL'),\r\n                'port' => env('PAPERTRAIL_PORT'),\r\n                'protocol' => ENV('LOG_PAPERTRAIL_PROTOCOL', 'syslog'),\r\n            ],\r\n        ],\r\n    ],\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# .env\r\n\r\n# Valid options: syslog, tcp\r\nLOG_PAPERTRAIL_PROTOCOL=tcp\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn *this* case, Vapor could automatically set `LOG_PAPERTRAIL_PROTOCOL=tcp` and things would just work on new Vapor projects out of the box.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure we'd need to allow people to override `LOG_PAPERTRAIL_HANDLER` in this case.  Totally happy to not include that in a patch if we want to try going in this direction.",

All sessions will be reset and of course any encrypted data will have to be decrypted using the old mode and then re-encrypted using the new mode.\r\n\r\nSo, any existing app should either keep using CBC mode, or carefully build a migration plan. We did migrate from CBC to CGM in a production app a few months ago successfully (no sessions invalidated) but we only used encryption for cookies. We built a custom encryptor that attempted both modes for decryption during a short transition period.\r\n",

Developers should consult the \"Usage Patterns\" section of the aforementioned documentation before deciding how best to set the `search_path`, as it has security implications.",

The number is actually 32, but bytes, not characters. Per [strlen() documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strlen.php):\r\n```strlen() returns the number of bytes rather than the number of characters in a string.```\r\n\r\nA few points:\r\n- A byte may be interpreted as a character or may not. In this case, because this is used for cryptography, the word \"character\" does not apply.\r\n- Bytes in text have to be encoded. In this case laravel uses base64.\r\n- Given that if the decoded length is incorrect, the app would not work (according to the linked PR), I changed the word \"should\" for the word \"must\".\r\n\r\nI have changed the documentation so that these points are clear.\r\n\r\nBtw, the length of each comment line might look familiar ;)\r\n```\r\n$ echo -n \"This key is used by the Illuminate encrypter service and must be set to\" | wc -m\r\n71\r\n$ echo -n \"a random 32 bytes base64 encoded string, otherwise encrypted strings\" | wc -m\r\n68\r\n$ echo -n \"will not be safe.

The added package is a thin wrapper around the [Enlightn security checker](https://github.com/enlightn/security-checker) package, which is relatively stable (~500k downloads).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nSymfony has [its own](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html#checking-security-vulnerabilities) `symfony check:security` command to scan app dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Drupal (Drush) [uses the Enlightn security checker](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/1750ad5ea07f6ca121919f2eff3cf900605faf35/composer.json#L42).\r\n\r\nI think it would be a good idea for Laravel to have its own security check command to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate how this would work, here's a Composer update that installs a non-patched/vulnerable dependency. The `security:check` command displays a warning on update.\r\n\r\n![sec-checker2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16099046/115505537-3baeb980-a297-11eb-8f19-f6af71281481.png)\r\n\r\n## Repository\r\n\r\nI thought this would be best suited for `laravel/laravel`. But if you think I should send this to some other repo (say framework or the installer), I'd be happy to do so.",

        "body": "This pr follows on from the discussion and pr found here: https://github.com/octobercms/october/pull/5468\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I've submitted something to the laravel repo.\r\n\r\nIf I'm correct this repo will be to update the config file and the laravel/framework repo will be doing the code processing for the config value.\r\n\r\nTo be honest I'm a bit confused on the laravel/framework repo side of things and not sure how to convert my pr into the laravel core code? If one of the Laravel team could look at my pr code and do the framework side, that would be really great, my original code is found here: https://github.com/octobercms/october/pull/5468/files\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pr is to add the extra security flags browsers have set up using cookie prefixes.\r\n\r\nTo learn more see here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-prefixes-00#section-3\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nMike West from Google said a good summary in a private conversation, see here:\r\n\r\n> `secure` ought to mean \"secure\": Though it's well-known that cookies\r\n> cross back and forth over protocol boundaries, recent research from\r\n> Zheng, et al. has highlighted the fact that this behaviour remains\r\n> surprising to developers, and also that there's little practical recourse\r\n> without changes in the browser.\r\n> \r\n> We intend to make it more difficult for non-secure origins to influence the\r\n> state of secure origins by preventing non-secure origins from writing\r\n> cookies with a 'secure' flag and overwriting cookies whose 'secure' flag is\r\n> set. We're also planning to tweak the eviction rules to ensure that a\r\n> host's non-secure cookies are removed before its secure cookies.\r\n\r\nA detailed explanation of the attack can be found here: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-zheng.pdf\r\n\r\n### PR Explanation\r\n\r\nBelow is the overview of the logic:\r\n\r\n- There is a new config setting in the `Session.php` config file, under the attribute `cookie_prefix`\r\n\r\nThis allows three settings:\r\n\r\n- `Secure` this is the **default** setting in Laravel and the cms will add the prefix, if the cookie name doesn't contain a hardcoded prefix, the cms is running `https` and the Cookie `Secure` setting is set to true. This setting allows subdomain cookies to work.\r\n\r\n```\r\n__Secure-laravel_session\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `Host` this is a more **strict** setting and the cms will add the prefix, if the cookie name doesn't contain a hardcoded prefix, the cms is running `https` and the Cookie `Secure` setting is set to true. This setting doesn't allow subdomains to work with the cookie and the cookie `path` must be set to `/`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n__Host-laravel_session\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `None` this completely turns off the cms from adding a cookie prefix automatically! This is not recommended, but I've added it to allow users to have complete control and be able to **opt-in** to this enhanced cookie security feature.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlaravel_session\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Browser Compatibility\r\n\r\nGoogle created the cookie prefix spec way back in 2015 and added it to Google Chrome 49.\r\n\r\nAll major browsers accept cookie prefixes, see below for the latest MDN browser compatibility stats.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57409060/105410542-fb08bb00-5c29-11eb-876d-a5e7da16cef4.png)\r\n\r\nFor browsers like `IE11` who don't use cookie prefixes, nothing will happen and nothing will break! Cookie prefixes have been fully tested to pass browsers that don't understand them!\r\n\r\nFor browsers that understand cookie prefixes - the browser will turn on an extra security flag - helping to prevent cookie smuggling attacks!\r\n",

        "body": "**Motivation**\r\nCurrently, there's no official guidance on how to register SPA routes in Laravel. I think the majority of folks use [`Route::fallback`](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/21299) to register a catch-all route for SPAs. While this does solve the problem to a certain extent, it is [not recommended for SEO](https://thegray.company/blog/single-page-application-spas-404s-seo) as it serves a 200 response code for every single route from the backend. Search engines such as Google call these [soft 404s](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/181708?hl=en) and currently have very little support to detect and flag such pages as 404s on their own.\r\n\r\nThere are other alternatives such as redirecting to a 404 page or serving a `no-index` meta tag. Ultimately, these are sub-par solutions. The best solution for SEO is to serve the correct 404 response code from the server. It not only solves the SEO issue at hand but also makes it easy for tools such as broken link checkers and analytics tools to flag errors.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it easy for Laravel users to register SPA routes (or patterns) in a single file so as to properly serve 404 response codes for un-registered routes.\r\n\r\n**Why not leave it to users to do this in their own apps**\r\nI reckon this is the 80% use case. Most web apps are using SPAs today (and Laravel has traditionally supported SPA frameworks such as Vue out-of-the-box) and this is probably a challenge for the majority of users that have SPAs.\r\n\r\n**Possible Extension**\r\nSometime down the road, we could even have SPA frameworks such as Vue or React generate a list of SPA route patterns from their routers as part of the build process and have PHP (the `routes/spa.php` file) cache and serve these routes.\r\n",

        "body": "This PR proposes to use **[Pest](https://pestphp.com/)** as the **default** testing framework in Laravel.\r\n\r\n## Advantages\r\n\r\n### Simple\r\n\r\nPest adheres to Laravel's core values by design. Its main focus is on **simplicity**:\r\n- Clean and expressive syntax\r\n- Extensive and thorough [documentation](https://pestphp.com/)\r\n- Easy to read errors and stack traces with the [most beautiful test reporting](https://pestphp.com/assets/img/collision.png) in the world\r\n\r\n### Powerful\r\n\r\nPest provides handy shortcuts to perform common actions in your tests:\r\n- **[Higher order tests](https://pestphp.com/docs/higher-order-tests/)**: easy to write, easy to read\r\n- **[Code coverage](https://pestphp.com/docs/coverage/)**: nice reporting straight from your console\r\n- **[Datasets](https://pestphp.com/docs/datasets/)**: they let you run the same test multiple times with different data\r\n\r\n### Backward compatible\r\n\r\nFirst of all,  **PHPUnit** would still be part of Laravel, as internally, Pest works on top of it. This should reassure most people with years of PHPUnit experience:\r\n\r\n- Pest can run existing PHPUnit test suites natively, no need to rewrite them\r\n- Pest can be a progressive buy-in, just write your new tests with its syntax\r\n- You can still run PHPUnit if you don't want to try Pest\r\n\r\n### Code example\r\n\r\nThe syntax should be familiar if you\u2019ve used other testing tools such as **Mocha** or **Jest**. Here\u2019s a quick example of what you can expect:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nbeforeEach(fn () => factory(App\\User::class)->create());\r\n\r\nit('has a home page', function () {\r\n    $this->get('/')->assertOk();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith its clean syntax, Pest have proven to help bring a few complete beginners to the testing world. Abstracting away most of PHPUnit's boilerplate code makes it easier for them to learn testing. This in itself should be a big benefit to the community.\r\n\r\n### Community\r\n\r\nPest already has dedicated team members working actively on multiple projects, including:\r\n\r\n- **[Documentation](https://pestphp.com)**\r\n- **[PHPStorm plugin](https://github.com/pestphp/pest-intellij)**\r\n- **[Framework features](https://github.com/pestphp/pest)**\r\n- **[Plugins](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins/livewire/)**\r\n- **[Videos](https://youtu.be/lEvau6CgqPE?t=125)**\r\n- **[Community Discord](https://discord.gg/bMAJv82)**",

        "body": "Hey everyone. With this PR I want to propose a new dedicated Integration test directory and in-memory DB defaults to the default Laravel test suite. As someone who's worked quite a bit with different test suites over the past years I think I can say for myself I have quite some experience in this area and wanted to share some small things through this PR.\r\n\r\n### In-memory DB\r\n\r\nThe first thing I want to change with this PR is to provide new defaults for the database that's being used when running the test suite of the app. **This is probably the very first thing I change for every single app I start working on.** All of my tests run in memory against a sqlite database which is pretty fast I must say. \r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the current default Laravel test suite doesn't requires a database to be set up, it is from my understanding that a lot of people do add these new defaults as soon as they need to start testing against a database. It's also true that an sqlite can't mimic a MySQL or Postgres database which is probably used in production but the speed of an in-memory database makes it much more suited for running tests. Therefor, I believe these are good defaults to have in the skeleton.\r\n\r\n### Integration Directory\r\n\r\nFrom what I often read on issues and on Twitter I still see that there's a lot of confusion about what a Unit test is and what an Integration test is. A unit test is something you test in isolation, without booting the entire app. You, for example, test a single object or function without any outside dependencies and maybe mock some of those dependencies. These tests usually run really fast.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests, however, are tests which test the behavior of different components together. They aren't full cycle tests like End-to-End tests or Feature tests but they do require some additional setup (like a database for example). These tests tend to run a bit slower.\r\n\r\nIn the current skeleton setup you only have two directories: a Unit test directory and a Feature test directory. I think there's room for an Integration directory which actually copies the behavior of the current Unit test directory. Because you see, the current default Unit ExampleTest extends from the default TestCase. This isn't wanted for unit tests because it boots up the entire framework and thus slows down these tests which should actually run much faster (because they should be isolated). \r\n\r\nWhat I changed is that I've added a dedicated Integration test directory which keeps the current behavior of extending from the Laravel TestCase class and can be used to test different components in your app which require the framework to be booted. The old Unit ExampleTest is updated to only extend the default PHPUnit Testcase so the framework isn't booted and you get the speed boost for these types of test. It's also ok that you don't have all of the Laravel test methods for the Unit tests because most of these methods are meant for Integration tests and provide no value in Unit tests.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to make a clear different between what a Unit test and what an Integration test is inside the example tests. For the Unit tests I'm testing if the User model accepts a name attribute and that it can be fetched properly (most people also don't realize you can perfectly Unit test Eloquent models as long as you don't do DB operations). For the Integration test I've added an example which actually makes use of the newly in-memory database defaults and I seed three users and fetch them with the User model.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWhat I'm mainly trying to achieve with these changes is to educate people better about testing in general and what the different types of tests are. And I'm hoping this saves a lot of people some time when they start on a new Laravel app (even though the changes are minimal).\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for writing such a large description. I'm usually against these myself hehe. But I wanted to be thorough enough to explain the reasoning behind it \ud83d\ude42 \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\n**Update**: Taking from the feedback here I've made changes to this PR.

        "body": "I ran into the problem that the bootstrapping of the unit tests crashed because the cached config file (`bootstrap/cache/phpunit.config.php`) contained a reference to a class that didn't exist anymore.\r\n\r\nThis problem happened to me when I removed a package that I had manually registered in my `config/app.php`. I think this can also happen when you rename classes.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. On a fresh Laravel install, install a package that you have to manually register in your `config/app.php`\r\n    - eg: `composer require clarification/sparkpost-laravel-driver`\r\n    - [manually register the provider](https://github.com/clarification/sparkpost-laravel-driver#install): `Clarification\\MailDrivers\\Sparkpost\\SparkpostServiceProvider::class`\r\n2. Run the unit tests\r\n    - `bootstrap/cache/phpunit.config.php` now contains the FQCN of the package\r\n3. Remove the provider from `config/app.php` and remove the package (`composer remove clarification/sparkpost-laravel-driver`)\r\n4. Try running the unit tests again\r\n\r\nYou should see the following error:\r\n```\r\nIn Application.php line 671:\r\n                                                                                  \r\n  Class 'Clarification\\MailDrivers\\Sparkpost\\SparkpostServiceProvider' not found  \r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm not very happy with this solution, but it works. Maybe someone has a better solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, this same bug might also exist with the other cached files.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "In `bootstrap.js` we currently add a `X-CSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header (note the 'C') to the Axios instance that we instantiate, using the value of a `<meta>` tag added by the auth scaffolding. This is not necessary because [Axios already has similar functionality](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/dist/axios.js#L1077) enabled by default where it will add a `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header (note the second 'X') using the value of the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie.\r\n\r\nOn a current installation of Laravel, our Axios instance requests have both the `X-CSRF-TOKEN` and the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP headers. The only difference is the `X-CSRF-TOKEN` value is unencrypted, while the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` value is encrypted.\r\n\r\nI believe we can safely remove the `X-CSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header configuration from `bootstrap.js` because Laravel already verifies requests using the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header in the [`VerifyCsrfToken` middleware](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.8/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php#L152). The same is also now true for [Passport >=7.4 `TokenGuard`](https://github.com/laravel/passport/blob/7.0/src/Guards/TokenGuard.php#L272) for users [consuming their API with JavaScript](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/passport#consuming-your-api-with-javascript).\r\n\r\nI have verified that this works on a fresh Laravel 5.8 installation for Axios POST requests going through our `web` middleware group, as well as requests going through the `auth:api` middleware when Passport is configured as linked above.\r\n\r\nI have submitted a draft PR at https://github.com/laravel/docs/pull/5382 to update the docs if this is accepted.",

This means, the `$request->user()` object is `null` in the [`resolveMaxAttempts()`](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.8/src/Illuminate/Routing/Middleware/ThrottleRequests.php#L73-L84) method, so it's not possible to retrieve the rate limiter attribute from the user. In this case,  we get a `429` HTTP error on the second API call, even if we are authenticated.\r\n\r\nWhen using the `actingAs()` method in tests, it binds the user \"manually\", so this problem does not occur.\r\n\r\nBy adding the `ThrottleRequests` class after the `SubstituteBindings` in the `$middlewarePriority` array, the user object (and its limiter attribute) would be available for the rate limiter. \r\n\r\nOf course, it's not a big deal to fix it manually for every project, but probably it would be a nice indication.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "This PR introduces a PHPUnit  ~~watcher~~ bootstrap file that caches the config before the test suite runs for the first time, which in [my benchmarks](https://timacdonald.me/the-case-laravel-testcase/) reduces the boot time of the Kernel during a test run by ~50% without any additional work by the developer.\r\n\r\nThis will only really have an impact on a larger test suite, but personally I think it is a worthwhile thing to consider.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark test suite ended up with the following durations:\r\n\r\n- Without caching: 9.15s\r\n- With caching: 4.2s\r\n\r\nCaching the config before a test run is good for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It's faster.\r\n2. It is closer reflects what you use in production.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, you cache your routes in production but try deploy a sneaky closure route, your app is gonna blow up when you go to cache the routes during production. Having this in place will help you catch that kind of thing during testing, either locally or during CI. (you could catch this in CI if you are already calling this command before running the tests).\r\n\r\nThe PHPUnit ~~listener~~ bootstrap file will cache the config for the test environment before a test is run. Because it is in \"User land\" it is 100% opt-in. If you don't want it, don't use it. One handy thing about running the cache command in a ~~PHPUnit listener~~ bootstrap file (as opposed to say in a composer script) is that it will already have the environment variables from the phpunit.xml file loaded, so we don't need to read those ourselves.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- As this doesn't require any changes to the framework, it is totally possible to just package up, which I'm more than happy to do.\r\n\r\n- The watcher could be kept in core with just the `phpunit.xml` changes made here.\r\n\r\n- it is possible we could see similar results by caching routes and events, but I haven\u2019t tested this yet. I plan to extend the benchmark repo I setup to also have some feature (http) tests so we can see what kind of impact that might have on a test suite as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a simpler approach to my first run at this: https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/28998",

If you want to use some of the functionality provided by the traits used in the base controller you can simply require them on those controllers. It's one less file for the skeleton and doesn't breaks anything atm. Updated the Auth controllers with the base route controller class since they don't need any of the traits.\r\n\r\nPeople are free to add this base controller if they want in their own projects.\r\n\r\nThis will need some updates to the docs as well which I'll work on if the PR gets merged.

See [fideloper/TrustedProxy/pull/117 ](https://github.com/fideloper/TrustedProxy/pull/117).\r\n\r\n**PROBLEM**: Hard coded settings in the TrustProxies middleware class.\r\n- Production: Probably you will use ELB.\r\n- Development: Probably you are not using ELB.\r\n\r\n**SOLUTION**: Moving settings to config file. Config file get settings from env file. Really easy to define your settings based on environments.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n1. Accept IPs separated by comma.\r\n    - You can add this config to the .env file:\r\n```config\r\nTRUSTEDPROXY_PROXIES='192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2'\r\n# More options\r\nTRUSTEDPROXY_PROXIES='*'\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Accept headers as a string.\r\n    - You can add this config to the .env file:\r\n```config\r\nTRUSTEDPROXY_HEADERS=\"HEADER_X_FORWARDED_ALL\"\r\n# More options\r\nTRUSTEDPROXY_HEADERS=\"HEADER_FORWARDED\"\r\nTRUSTEDPROXY_HEADERS=\"HEADER_X_FORWARDED_AWS_ELB\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Added support for AWS ELB.\r\n\r\n**Maybe you want to add this to the laravel documentation.**\r\nIf you are using AWS ELB with HTTPS you can configure your Nginx like this:\r\n```nginx\r\nserver {\r\n    # all traffic, secure or otherwise, comes in on 80 from the ELB\r\n    listen 80;\r\n    .......\r\n\r\n    # ELB stores the protocol used between the client\r\n    # and the load balancer in the X-Forwarded-Proto request header.\r\n    # Check for 'https' and redirect if not\r\n    if ($http_x_forwarded_proto != 'https') {\r\n        return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;\r\n    }\r\n    .......\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n",

In the past, we included all Sass dependencies with each install of Mix, regardless of whether the user desired Sass compilation for their app. With v4, Mix now install those dependencies on the fly - only if the user requests it with `mix.sass()`. However, because laravel/laravel includes Sass boilerplate, I added them here to skip the extra download step. \r\n\r\n2. As part of the vue-loader 13 update, if you use the CommonJS-style `require` for importing ES modules, you must now add `.default`. See the [vue-loader release notes](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/releases/tag/v13.0.0) for more details, if interested. (Personally, I think this repo should be updated to exclusively use ES modules, but that's a different PR.)\r\n\r\n3. I did a fresh production recompile for the `app.js` and `app.css` files that are included with Laravel out of the box.\r\n\r\nOkay, think that's it.",

Using this, we can automatically register all the Vue components in the `/js` directory. This happens at build time, so there is no performance implications.\r\n\r\nNote, this will register Vue components in sub folders as well, so it's the developer's responsibility to avoid naming collisions, since the folder name isn't included in the component name (although it could be added if they wanted). I don't see this as an issue, in fact I like it since it allows organization of Vue files into folders, but it's good to be aware of.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n- `/js/components/ExampleComponent.vue` becomes `<example-component></example-component>`\r\n- `/js/components/Autocomplete.vue` becomes `<autocomplete></autocomplete>`\r\n- `/js/pages/CreateUser.vue` becomes `<create-user></create-user>`\r\n- `/js/Layout.vue` becomes `<layout></layout>`",

        "body": "Hey all,\r\n\r\nSince `nunamaduro\\collision` is now included by default in Laravel 5.6 (and recently updated to `~2.0`, which supports `phpunit ~7.0`), I thought it would make sense to add it to the phpunit configuration by default, so everyone gets those sweet exceptions and stack traces when running tests.\r\n\r\nThe reason I've sent this PR to the `master` branch instead of `5.6` is because it stops `phpunit` from running when `nunamaduro\\collision` is still at version `~1.1`, and I assume many early adopters still have that version set in their `composer.json` file.\r\n\r\nI've tested this change against the latest `master` commit after running `composer install` and the configuration change seems to work fine and causes no issues.\r\n\r\nExample screenshot:\r\n![phpunit-collision](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7504556/36473012-a29b979a-16f3-11e8-8260-2cecf209687a.jpg)\r\n\r\nI understand if there's hesitation to add yet another default setting based on a dependency not everyone might use, but I think it's a sensible decision given that the default Laravel install already installs `phpunit` and `collision`.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n",

        "body": "Reverts laravel/laravel#4574\r\n\r\nSorry, but I dont think this was given the correct level of discussion regarding the huge unintended side effects this PR is going to have.\r\n\r\nEssentially we are now permanently faking composer to pretend that every Laravel install is running on PHP `7.1.3` out of the box.\r\n\r\nThis is going to artifically limit everyone as packages start increasing their dependencies to PHP `>=7.1.4`, because the default Laravel install will *never* get those packages. And it will be a **silent** failure - because composer will just grab the older versions without complaining.\r\n\r\nOf course - people are free to edit their `composer.json` with the right version. But then they need to do this. every. single. time.\r\n\r\nPlus - when you do `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog` - that will only install 7.1.3 packages initially. You then need to go into `composer.json` and set your PHP version manually (to say `7.2.0`), then run `composer update` every. single. project. to make sure you have the \"correct\" versions at the start.\r\n\r\n> If someone generates a lock file on PHP 7.2, then tries to deploy to a sever running PHP 7.1, then they're in for a mess \r\n\r\nAnyone who develops for a PHP7.1 server on a PHP7.2 dev box is in for a mess regardless. All it takes is the use of one PHP7.2 feature or syntax in their application, and it'll break on production anyway. I dont understand why we are protecting a small amount of people who develop on an incompabable version of PHP to their production, vs the large amount of people who do the right thing. Those that need this feature can just add it themselves to `composer.json`. \r\n\r\nWe've already got 2 people raising issues in the original PR, and this hasnt even been tagged yet.\r\n\r\nFinally, and this is my biggest concern - the **real** side effects of this wont be felt for 6-12 months. This is a **silent** failure to stick to PHP7.1 - it is not obvious, and people will miss this every time. We would have to add a large warning to the Laravel docs, and to the installer itself, telling people to manually set the `composer.json`. And they need to remember to update it if/when they update their PHP environments.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think just let composer do it's own thing - and leave the artifical constrant to people who actually need it.",

But as revealed after some integrations in different projects it has issues:\r\n- long namespaces cutted down (only ending part is visible) what makes understanding whats broken more complicated;\r\n- it doesn't show what test is failed, it only shows how much success\\fail tests were in Test Case.\r\n\r\nThen @brunogaspar shared link on another great tool: https://github.com/LimeDeck/phpunit-detailed-printer which I'm proposing to add instead of solution described above.\r\n\r\nBenefits of PHPUnit Detailed Printer:\r\n- Displays fully qualified namespace of Test Case.\r\n- Displays each test from Test Case in human readable format by converting `function it_can_fill_body_attribute` to `It can fill body attribute`.\r\n- Displays execution time for each test with highlighting slow tests.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it will be good to have such detailed information in projects with thousands of tests, but it works great in most of the cases by giving you much more overview about your tests.\r\n\r\nThanks to @carusogabriel and @brunogaspar for the suggestions. Even if this wouldn't be added to the core - this will be helpful starting point to add this manually to the project.\r\n\r\nAnd here is a screenshot of how it will look like:\r\n\r\n![detailed-printer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LimeDeck/phpunit-detailed-printer/master/screenshots/phpunit-pretty.png \"PHPUnit output with this printer.\")",

I have to manually copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and then run `php artisan key:generate` before I can view my new laravel app.\r\n\r\nAnyway, maybe there was another reason behind this.

        "body": "## Proposition ##\r\nA Content Security Policy (CSP) header provides mitigation in the case an XSS attack succeeds. Many people do not know what a CSP header is, so providing one out-of-the-box greatly increases the exposure of this security technique. It also increases the security of Laravel setups with relatively little effort or maintenance on the Laravel side.\r\n\r\n## Sounds great, but what's a CSP exactly?(tl;dr below) ##\r\n### Quick XSS recap ###\r\nFirst things first. You have probably heard of XSS attacks, where some input that should not be trusted is not properly sanitised and displayed to users, allowing an attacker to run code. If you're using Laravel properly and using security best practices, the input that you display is always sanitised and XSS is not possible. Alas, we do not live in a perfect world and devs are not perfect, so XSS happens often. XSS can also occur in edge cases, where you pull data from a \"trusted\" system which then has XSS problems of its own.\r\n### XSS in practice ###\r\nThe above is where XSS explanations usually stop, but XSS attacks are naturally limited in scope by a very simple fact: your input is usually limited to some maximum length. Imagine you properly protected your comment system by sanitising the body text. Great! Except you forgot to also sanitise some metadata like the author name or some signature: woops! The attacker can then do an XSS attack using the author name, but your system probably does not allow the author name to be longer than, say, 100 characters. This means the attacker also cannot insert more than 100 characters of code, at least somewhat limiting the complexity of his/her attack.\r\n### So XSS attacks are not very effective then? ###\r\nUnfortunately not...because the attacker can simply pull in external code from his/her own server! Attackers usually host some malicious code on a short URL like foo.uk/a.js in order to stay under the limit of whatever input they try to exploit. Obviously the attacker can then run whatever code he/she wants, of arbitrary length and complexity.\r\n### So does CSP protect against this? ###\r\nYes. A Content Security Policy is basically a whitelist of where the browser should pull resources from. If the attacker's server foo.uk is not in the whitelist, then the server refuses to load the code. It gets even better, because you can also tell the browser it should not execute any code in <script> tags at all, limiting the attack scope even more.\r\n\r\n## CSP tl;dr ##\r\nA Content Security Policy is basically a whitelist that tells the server where it can load resources from. If an attacker tries to pull code from his/her own server, the browser will refuse to do it. This limits the scope of the XSS attack, because the attacker's code then has to fit in whatever field he/she is exploiting. Very strict CSP's can even block <script> tags all together or block dynamic code execution (eval).\r\n\r\n## How do we add this to Laravel? ##\r\nI created a very simple global middleware similar to, for example, TrimStrings that just adds a CSP header to all request responses. The default CSP header works with the default Laravel project and allows unsafe-eval on scripts (Vue.js needs this), unsafe-inline because we use a script tag to put the CSRF token in window.Laravel.csrfToken and also use onclick=\"\" on the logout button, it also allows styles to be loaded from https://fonts.googleapis.com and fonts from https://fonts.gstatic.com. This middleware is then registered as a global middleware in Kernel.php. All together it's really just a few lines of code!\r\n\r\n### So it's simple and short, but why add it to Laravel and not publish it as a package? ###\r\nVery simple: exposure. Even if you decide to make this an opt-in feature, if 10% of the people who start a new Laravel project decide to enable the CSP header because it's already there anyway and they read about it in the documentation, then that's a big win for online security as XSS attacks are potentially mitigated. Over time it may increase the security of Laravel setups that are out there.\r\n\r\n### Should it be opt-in or opt-out? ###\r\nIn an ideal world it's opt-out, a fresh Laravel project starts with a simple and strict CSP header and you need to adjust it if you decide to load external resources, e.g. from a CDN. Unfortunately it's very likely people will not look at their browser's console and not read the documentation and report an issue if something doesn't work.\r\n#### What about opt-out with a more relaxed CSP? ####\r\nOpt-out is still possible by providing a CSP that fits the 80% use-case, e.g. add the most common CDNs that people use, analytics URLs, etc. This does put more maintenance stress on the Laravel devs, because this default CSP header needs to be kept up-to-date. Also, people who fall out of the default use-case may still complain.\r\n#### Opt-in alternative ####\r\nOpt-in would simply mean provide the CSP header middleware by default and make sure it works with the default Laravel project. Since the default project doesn't change that often, this isn't really hard on maintenance. Then, comment out the line that registers the CSP middleware as a global middleware. Users can then enable it by simply uncommenting the line. The documentation can provide some explanation about CSP headers and suggest to developers that they use it if they're starting a new project anyway, together with some useful resources.\r\n#### Even if it's opt-in, do we want a very strict CSP for higher security? ####\r\nCurrently the CSP allows <script> tags by specifying unsafe-inline, because they're used in two places (csrfToken and logout button). It's possible to move this code to bootstrap.js or app.js so we can block <script> tags by default entirely. This make the XSS mitigation stronger, but users must then put all their JS code in files and compile it using Laravel Mix. Security-wise, this is definitely preferred, but for user friendliness you may want to allow unsafe-inline by default and simply point out in the documentation that this feature exists if people want it. The reverse is having a strict CSP and pointing out that users need to add unsafe-inline for script tags.\r\n\r\n### Secure alternative to blocking <script> tags ###\r\nIt may be unpractical to block every single use of <script> tags in your project, but fortunately the CSP developers also thought of this. What I previously discussed is only CSP level 1. CSP level 2 adds nonces, so <script> tags can still be blocked, but <script nonce=\"dADdke892Zx\"> is allowed. It would be possible to add a simple Laravel feature (perhaps in Blade?) that adds the nonce to all script tags created in some special way (e.g. using Blade). This is pretty similar to CSRF protection, but then for your DOM. Adding this would be more user friendly and secure at the same time, but also requires some more work; generate a valid nonce on the server and inject it in script tags.\r\n\r\n## What about browser support? ##\r\nAccording to Can I Use, 93.31% of browsers support CSP level 1 and 74.08% supports CSP level 2. It's just a header, so if the browser doesn't support it it's only ignored.\r\n\r\n## Are there other security headers? ##\r\nYes! Other options to add by default (these are much simpler so I'm not going to give a big explanation) are \"X-Xss-Protection 1; mode=block\" (obvious), \"X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN\" (prevents clickjacking by embedding your site in an iframe), \"x-permitted-cross-domain-policies none\" (similar to previous), \"X-Content-Type-Options nosniff\" (Don't MIME-sniff the content-type of a response, just use what is declared) and setting a referrer-policy for privacy if wanted. Some of these are so widely used that they can easily be added to the default Laravel project so that less experienced developers don't forget them and miss out on security.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion ##\r\nBecause many developers are not aware of what CSP headers can do and that they can mitigate XSS attacks and because security is super important, I believe it's a great idea to provide one out-of-the-box even if it's just opt-in with some explanation in the documentation. Opt-out is also possible, and I outlined some pro/cons of this above. Even more advanced approaches are also possible using CSP level 2 and nonces.\r\n\r\n## Resources ##\r\nhttps://www.troyhunt.com/understanding-csp-the-video-tutorial-edition/\r\nhttps://content-security-policy.com/\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP\r\nhttp://caniuse.com/#search=csp\r\nhttps://scotthelme.co.uk/hardening-your-http-response-headers/\r\nhttps://www.troyhunt.com/clickjack-attack-hidden-threat-right-in/\r\nhttps://www.perpetual-beta.org/weblog/security-headers.html\r\n\r\nFeedback is very welcome!

That's where this PR comes in.\n\nInstead of always displaying the 'Login' and 'Register' links on the top right of the welcome screen, when the user is signed in, a link to the 'Home' page is displayed.\n\nThis can easily be used to determine if you are currently signed in (without having to click either link and be redirected to the 'Home' page).\n\n**tl;dr**\nAdds a 'Home' link to the `welcome.blade.php` file. You can easily see if you are signed in.\n\n(Edit: Woah. This is the 4,000th pull request \ud83d\ude03)\n(Edit 2: _sigh_ I just found another pull request with this. Sorry.)\n",

As mentioned in Laravel Middleware Docs \n\n> HTTP middleware provide a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application.\n\nThis Validator Middleware will validate data before allowing the request to proceed further into the application.\nSimplifying validation procedure using the Validator Middleware:-\n1. Declare the Validator in Model\n2. Add the Middleware to the controller wherever needed with Model name passed as parameter\n    validator:Model_Name\n",

This would allow you to run migrations and complete composer updates directly from the terminal without needing to login to the VM. \n\nOf course if your VM environment does not have an APP_ENV declared then it would inherit from the .env, but for the majority of us on Homestead that is simply not the case. \n\nDont know about valet since I am on Windows but i assume that you would need a local install of SQL and assign the port manually anyways. \n\nI fail to see the downside overall, but perhaps i can be enlightened...\n",

Probably either `routes-api.php` or `api.php`, so if you went with that ideally you would want to be consistent and would rename `routes.php` to `routes-web.php` or `web.php` to match. Not doing so would result in having `routes.php` and `routes-api.php` or `api.php`, and that lack of consistency seems a little sloppy.\n\nPersonally I think keeping all routes files in a separate directory to avoid the `routes-` prefix of the routes files is preferable, (one file per middleware group) so that's what I've done here, but I'm happy to change it if others prefer.\n\nThe main issue is the inconsistency of having a specific middleware group routes file being given a general, non-specific name.\n",

Now we normalized it to actually run an update and fire pre/post-update-cmd, because that's what it is doing. If you have a lock file though it will run install as before.\n\nWhen installing without lockfile, Composer now behaves as upgrade. It also executes the `pre-upgrade-cmd` instead of `pre-install-cmd`. Behaviour with composer.lock available is not changed.\n\nWith the latest composer version, doing a fresh install will fail because the vendor files are not yet present.\n",

Then it does esencially what the clear-compiled command does without the application and then exits.\n",

        "body": "This is a RESTful style controller I use in my own projects.\n\nThis controller is similar to the resource controller provided by Laravel framework, which supports 7 actions: \n\n```\nindex/create/store/show/edit/update/destroy\n```\n\nHowever, this controller is more flexible in defining/extending actions. Some business-specific actions can be defined easily, especially for PUT requests, such as:\n\n```\nPUT /books/352/rename\nPUT /books/352/star\n```\n\nUsage:\n1. Create a controller class extending RESTfulController\n2. Define methods for actions, for example:\n\n`\nprotected function putIDRename($id) { ... }\n`\n\n`\nprotected function putIDStar($id) { ... }\n`\n\n`\nprotected function deleteID($id) { ... }\n`\n\nThe `ID` part in the method name works as a placeholder, and can be defined to your own pattern, see `getMethodNameIDPlaceHolder` method for more details.\n\nThe method name looks similar to the request uri and is thus easy to remember and find.\n\nYou can also define custom pattern of the resource ID, see `getIDPattern` and `decodeID` methods for more details.\n\nThere are some limitions of this controller.\n1. It can work with the route filters but only the \"only\" type of before/after filters are supported at the moment.\n2. The middleware introduced in Laravel 5 is not supported yet.\n3. The implementation depends on some implementation details of the route subsystem, which may change in future Laravel versions.\n\nReferences: \n1. http://codeplanet.io/principles-good-restful-api-design/\n2. https://bourgeois.me/rest/\n3. http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2014/05/restful_api.html\n",

On the top of 503.blade.php I have @extends('app', ['down'=>true]) , passing it in. As long as you don't use the variable down in your master template, this shouldn't harm anything.\n\nUpon clicking refresh your page, it calls location.reload() , which should refresh the page and bring back the page if you had put the application down.\n\nUpon clicking the email address, it will open a mailto link.\n\nI'm open to criticism, this is my first pull request to a major project. The only problem I see may be that this is too complex for a down screen, however I think that it is basic enough.\n",

However, if you know little about `.htaccess` files, you might spend an hour trying to figure out why you were redirected to the web root when an extra slash was added at the end.\n\nIt's important to note that this change does not appear adversely affect anything if we still use the web root.\n",

        "body": "Filename-based cache busting is a popular approach to versioning public assets. Put simply, it allows the injection of a version number into an asset's filename without actually having to renaming the file itself. This allows for far-future expires headers on public assets with an easy way to break this cache. This is done using URL rewriting, currently only possible when using Apache or Nginx, not the built-in PHP server.\n\nThe following addition to `server.php` adds this functionality to the local development server. This shouldn't have any backwards breaking side effects, since it first checks to see if the file already exists.\n\nI debated using [fileinfo](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.finfo-file.php) to determine the mime type, but this seemed like overkill considering how few asset types this is required for. Further, I've noticed issues with fileinfo in certain environments where the definition (magic) file is out of date.\n\nAs noted in the comments, this approach was made popular by the HTML5 Boilerplate project. See their [.htaccess](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/.htaccess#L624) file for more information.\n\nI believe this should be part of the default Laravel install because:\n1. Filename-based cache busting is used by many Laravel developers\n2. Without it developers have to \"duck tape\" a solution together for their dev environment\n3. Without it developers may be less likely to use this very smart approach to cache busting\n4. Not having this creates a barrier to using the built-in PHP server for those familiar with using `.htaccess` files\n5. I don't see any backwards compatibility issues\n6. The work is done :)\n\nThanks!\n",

        "body": "This PR removes the lockfile from .gitignore, mentions not committing it in contributing.md and excludes it from git-archive, meaning that if it is accidentally committed most users won't download it.\n\n---\n\nThis issue tripped me up again today - wondering why my tiny 512MB instance couldn't install Composer dependencies (doesn't need a ton of memory if you have a lockfile :smile:). Modifying .gitignore is the first thing I have to do each time I start a project.\n\nFrom #2293 the consensus seems to be that the lockfile shouldn't be in .gitignore. While this project only has one dependency it probably shouldn't have a lockfile either (I think that laravel/framework should but that's a different issue).\n\nAdditionally, most people get this repo from GitHub as an archive or from `composer create-project` which gets the same archive by default. This is handy as we can [exclude files from git-archive](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitattributes.html#_creating_an_archive) (what GitHub uses to create the archives). Even if the lockfile _is_ committed, unless the user clones the repo or uses `--prefer-source` (for whatever reason) they won't end up with a stale copy.\n\n---\n\nI don't know why it says there's an error checking the merge status, but I'm assured not to worry, so I won't.\n",

        "body": "When using the Auth filter, if the user is not authenticated we currently redirect them to the login route.\n\nIf the request was an AJAX request, redirecting to an HTML form makes no sense. Instead, we should return a 401 unauthorized header, so that the client code can listen for that and do its own redirection/authentication.\n\n---\n\nHere's some sample code I use with jQuery:\n\n```\n$.ajaxSetup({\n    statusCode: {\n        401: function () {\n            window.location = '/login';\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nAnd here's some sample code that I use with AngularJS:\n\n```\n// angular doesn't automatically set the X-Requested-With header\n$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With'] = 'XMLHttpRequest';\n\n// Redirect AJAX calls that return a 401 status code\n$httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push(function ()\n{\n    return function ( promise )\n    {\n        return promise.then(function ( response )\n        {\n            return response;\n        },\n        function ( response )\n        {\n            if ( response.status == 401 ) window.location.reload();\n        });\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThis angular app uses html5mode single page navigation, so that the new request to the same route will be redirected to `login` with `::intended()`, and would then be redirected back to the requested URL.

        "body": "Here's the theory behind this:\n\nLet's say I wanted to create a bundle that allowed for adding timestamps to an eloquent model.  Yes, Laravel already does it, but pretend it didn't.  As of now, you'd need to give instructions to users to create the two new columns in their table, make sure they named them correctly and had the right column type, etc..\n\nBy allowing table macros, you can do all the hard work for them.  In the fictional Timestampable bundle's `start.php` file, you could include code like this:\n\n``` php\nLaravel\\Database\\Schema\\Table::macro('timestampable', function($table) {\n    $table->date('created_at');\n    $table->date('updated_at');\n});\n```\n\nThen, the user only needs to do this in their migrations:\n\n``` php\nSchema::create('foo', function($table)\n{\n    $table->increments('id');\n    $table->string('name');\n    $table->timestampable();\n});\n```\n\nOf course, you would also create a `Timestampable` trait that would manage the setting and updating of those values on `save()` ... but that's not important here.\n\nSo, the main reason is to allow bundle authors the ability to do custom schema declarations, without pushing the complexity to the end user.  As a more complex example, consider:\n\n``` php\nLaravel\\Database\\Schema\\Table::macro('uploader', function($table, $file) {\n    $table->string($file.'_name');\n    $table->string($file.'_original_name');\n    $table->integer($file.'_size');\n});\n\n...\n\nSchema::create('user', function($table)\n{\n    $table->increments('id');\n    $table->string('name');\n    $table->uploader('avatar');\n});\n```\n",

It iterates over one edge of the relationship and then uses array_filter and array_first to identify the models on the other edge that match.\n\nI did some improvements on Relationship::match method. And created a small benchmark to compare performance: paste.laravel.com/7dt\n\nWith 250 children matching 50 parents, the results on my Macbook Pro were:\n\n```\nCurrent Iteration: 187ms (total array iterations = 12550)\nOptimized Iteration: 3ms (total array iterations = 300)\n```\n\nThe great thing is that this method I'm suggesting grows linearly with the number of models, while the other grows exponentially and if you try to load more models, it's time will increase even more and so it's CPU and memory usage.\n\nOn small applications that load 20-30 items per page, this passes unnoticed. But for Laravel to reach enterprise class, this kind of optimization is necessary.\n",

Asset_Container->asset() should not validate the URL because calling HTML::script() and HTML::style() both validate URLs implicitly by calling URL::to_asset() on the url. By removing this duplication we can validate once and have no reimplementation to worry about altering functionality later.\n2. Extending URL::valid() to support a protocol-less URL by prepending `http:` before running filter_var on it.\n",

That way, calling code such as `Command::run()` can be deferred until the bundle has started properly.\n\nThe other alternative - and this is where I'd like some input - would be to mark the bundle as started just before the start.php file is included.

Instead, every attribute's value was passed to the attribute's setter method (if it existed), causing e.g. duplicate hashing of passwords.\n\nIn fact, the copying of the attributes of the model object passed to `insert()` to an entirely new object is completely unnecessary.

If you apply a validation rule like `match:/^[0-9]{1,10}/` or `match:/^[0|9]{1,10}/`, you would encounter the error `preg_match(): No ending delimiter '/' found`. This happens because the parameter `/^[0-9]{1,10}/` is splited on the ',' into an array and only the first element of that array is passed to the `preg_match()` function (see line 645):\n\n```\nprotected function validate_match($attribute, $value, $parameters)\n{\n    return preg_match($parameters[0], $value);\n\n}\n```\n## Fix\n\nJoining the parameter array into a string and pass it to the `preg_match()` function.\n\n```\nprotected function validate_match($attribute, $value, $parameters)\n{\n    return preg_match(join(\",\", $parameters), $value);\n}\n```\n\nTo solve the problem with '|' in regex I modified the parsing of the rules by using \nthe `str_getcsv()` function. So you could enclose your match rule in two \" like \nin csv-files `$rules = array('test' => '\"match:/^[a|z]{1,5}$/\"');`.\nNow the problem is that you couldn't use a \" in your regex string, because \" \nis the string delimiter for the rule fields. But instead of a \" you can now use '\\x22'.\n\n```\n$rules = array('test' => 'size:5|\"match:/^[\\x22|a|z]{1,5}$/\"');\n```\n\nKeep in mind, that you have to use a single quoted regex string, because the \\x22 will\nbe replaced by a \" and results in an error (`preg_match(): Unknown modifier '\"'`).\n## Summary/Documentation\n- Completly backward compatible\n- Unit tested\n- If you want to use a validation rule with an argument containing a '|' you have to enclose \n  the whole rule in \": `$rules = array('test' => size:2|\"in:.,|,:\"');`\n- If you want to use the match rule with a \" and a '|' in your regex string than \n  you have to you have to enclose the whole rule in two '\"' (see above), replace the\n  \" with '\\x22' and use single quoted string only: `$rules = array('test' => 'size:5|\"match:/^[\\x22|a|z]{1,5}$/\"');`\n## Tip\n\nIf you have a very complicated regex c&p from the internet it could be easier to\nregister a small custom validation rule containing a preg_match() and your regex.\n:-)\n\nHappy coding,\nChristian\n",

This could be avoided or at least made obvious by introducing regression tests when fixing bugs.\n\nVery strict pull request guidelines would also reduce a little bit of workload on the core team, keep code quality high and teach contributors a lot. That is quite important - Gina Trapani's ThinkUp project is a very good example of this.\n\nAs a small start, here's a proposal for some very basic pull request guidelines, mentioning documentation and unit tests. (Travis CI integration would be a big plus here. Cough.)\n\nI'm not the best writer, so maybe someone should go over this and extend it in some places.\n\nI am also hoping for some input on the general guidelines, but I thought this needed a start... :)\n",

Vice versa is also true, but not a problem in this case.\n\nThus, calling `EloquentModel::table()` calls the instance method normally, which results in static calls and class determination being made to the class which called the method statically.\n\nThis is (hopefully) a bug in PHP, but converting `table()` to be a static method fixes the problem.\n\nNote that the change in `__call` is likely to not make any difference, as PHP does never actually get there. This may be different on other versions of PHP.\n\n---\n\nPHP test script:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n\nclass Model\n{\n    public static function static_method()\n    {\n        echo get_called_class(), PHP_EOL;\n        echo __FUNCTION__, PHP_EOL;\n    }\n\n    public function instance_method()\n    {\n        echo get_class($this), PHP_EOL;\n        echo __FUNCTION__, PHP_EOL;\n    }\n\n    public function __call($method, $parameters)\n    {\n        echo __FUNCTION__, PHP_EOL;\n    }\n\n    public static function __callStatic($method, $parameters)\n    {\n        echo __FUNCTION__, PHP_EOL;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Context\n{\n    public function call()\n    {\n        $model = new Model();\n        $model->static_method();\n\n        echo PHP_EOL;\n\n        Model::instance_method();\n\n        echo PHP_EOL, PHP_EOL;\n    }\n}\n\nContext::call();\n\n$context = new Context();\n$context->call();\n```\n\noutputs:\n\n```\nModel\nstatic_method\n\nModel\ninstance_method\n\n\nModel\nstatic_method\n\nContext\ninstance_method\n```\n\nAs you can see, calling the instance method from an instance yields the wrong results.\n",

        "body": "I have created a lot of migrations since I started using Laravel, and over the time, **nearly 100% of them looked like this** :\n\n``` php\n<?php\nclass {{class}}\n{\n  /**\n   * Make changes to the database.\n   *\n   * @return void\n   */\n  public function up()\n  {\n    Schema::create('{{table}}', function($table)\n    {\n      $table->increments('id');\n      // More fields\n    });\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Revert the changes to the database.\n   *\n   * @return void\n   */\n  public function down()\n  {\n    Schema::drop('{{table}}');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo that's pretty much what this pull request does : it allows you to do `artisan migrate:make create_users users` where `create_users` is the migration name and `users` is the table name.\nI wonder if some sort of shortcut might in some way be created, allowing the migration name to be determined by the table's name (ie. users -> create_users, etc.) which pretty much seems to be the convention anyway.\n\nI really think Laravel should merge Bob, as all the scaffolding options it offers not only put Laravel on the level of Rails's `scaffold`, but it would really help newcomers a lot when trying to create new controllers, models, migrations etc. It offers a solid base convention on which they can learn and bootstrap. \nWell that's just my opinion anyway. \n",

Fixed conditional statement to only accept exactly 2 arguments.\n\nIn the `route()` method, `URI::current()` was evaluating as '/' in all situations. It was never evaluating as the route that you specified when executing the command. This could be part of a larger underlying bug with Symfony's `HttpFoundation\\Request` class. It might be a band-aid fix, but replacing `URI::current()` with `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` allows the method to run the correct route.\n\nThese fixes uncovered what I believe is potentially another bug. When `var_dump($route->response())` is run, \"NULL\" and a newline is appended to the output. It's something to do with `var_dump()`, as echo `$route->response()` echo's the correct output without the extra \"NULL\".\n\nSigned-off-by: Jakobud jake.e.wilson@gmail.com\n",

I needed this functionality in a project, and wrote and tested the code to ensure it works for all drivers. \n\nSample usage:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n$columns = DB::table('sessions')->columns();\nforeach($columns as $column)\n{\n    echo \"{$column->name}: {$column->type} <br>\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\nBy default only the 'name' and 'type' fields are returned. These fields will **always** be returned for all drivers. If the optional `$all_info` parameter is set to `true` (ex: `DB::table('sessions')->columns(true)`), all the available information (which differs from driver to driver) for the columns will be returned in addition to the 'name' and 'type' fields.\n\nCaveats:\n- All information is always returned for the SQLite driver (5 fields total), but that should not be a problem.\n- The 'type' values may be different from driver to driver. It may be worth the effort to standardize these at some point. For example, for a varchar field:\n  - SQLite returns `VARCHAR`\n  - MySQL returns something like `varchar(40)`, depending on the length\n  - PostgreSQL returns `character varying`\n  - SQL Server returns `nvarchar`\n",

So the browse to user/edit and get a form. In the form, we use the hidden field named `lock_version`. E.g. the lock_verson is 3 and was filled from the database. \n\n```\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"lock_version\" value=\"{{$user->lock_version}}\"/>\n```\n\nNow person 1 saves the changed user record, save() uses the id and lock_version to find the record where the changes are based on. Record was found and updated. lock_version is now 4. \n\nPerson 2 changes the record too. The edit_action would look something like\n\n```\n...\npublic function action_edit($id)\n    {\n    if (! $user = User::find($id)) {\n        $data['error'] = \"User with id $id not found.\";\n        return View::make('user.index', $data);\n    }\n\n    if (Input::get()) {\n        try {\n            $user->fill(Input::get()); // here the version gets overwritten from the forms value!\n            $user->save();\n            return Redirect::to('user/list')->with('success','User ' . $user . ' updated.');\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            $data['error'] = $e->getMessage();\n            $data['user'] = $user;\n            return View::make('user.edit', $data);\n        }\n    }\n\n    $data['user'] = $user;\n    return View::make('user.edit', $data);\n}\n...\n```\n\nSo you see the user data which we get using user->find() were overwritten, so was `lock_version`. It gets value 3 as in the hidden field of the form. save() can not update by `id=x` and `lock_version=3`.\n\nThe record was not found and can not be updated. So person 2 does not make unwanted overwrites. Person 2 changes are based on a outdated record. \n\nSigned-off-by: Ren\u00e9 Moser mail@renemoser.net\n",

This is useful where the database system's default character set and/or collation is not set to the character set/collation desired for the table/column.\n\nThe default character set is the value set in the charset option in the MySQL database configuration in /application/config/database.php\n\nThe default collation is set by the MySQL server.\n\nTables and columns can both have their character set/collation set individually.\n\nExample migration:\n\n``` php\n/**\n * File: /application/migrations/2012_07_02_193607_create_mixed_charset_table.php\n */\n\nclass Create_Mixed_Charset_Table {\n\n    /**\n     * Make changes to the database.\n     *\n     * @return void\n     */\n    public function up()\n    {\n        Schema::create('my_mixed_table', function($table) {\n            $table->charset('utf8'); // same as default\n            // $table->collate('utf8_unicode_ci'); // default is 'utf_general_ci'\n\n            $table->increments('id');\n\n            // uses table default values\n            $table->string('text_default', 100);\n\n            // force Latin 1, collation is default for this charset\n            $table->string('text_latin1', 100)->charset('latin1');\n\n            // force a specific collation\n            $table->string('text_utf8_unicode_ci', 100)->collate('utf8_unicode_ci');\n\n            // force Latin 1 with a specific collation\n            $table->string('text_latin1_german_ci', 100)->charset('latin1')->collate('latin1_german1_ci');\n        });\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Revert the changes to the database.\n     *\n     * @return void\n     */\n    public function down()\n    {\n        Schema::drop('my_mixed_table');\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nThis results in the following SQL:\n\n``` sql\nCREATE TABLE `my_mixed_table` (\n  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  `text_default` varchar(100) NOT NULL,\n  `text_latin1` varchar(100) CHARACTER SET latin1 NOT NULL,\n  `text_utf8` varchar(100) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,\n  `text_latin1_german` varchar(100) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_german1_ci NOT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\n```\n\nNote that specifying an invalid character set or collation will result in a SQL error.\n",

This is solved by passing `$_SERVER['argv']` through to `phpunit`, which allows you to do something like `php artisan test --verbose`. The only 'gotcha' with this is that Laravel has a funny way of parsing options, so if you want to do something like `php artisan test --configuration my/custom/config.xml` you actually need to do `php artisan test --configuration=my/custom/config.xml` \n",

So, we'd obviously have to make sure the entity is not `NULL` before accessing it.

Consider this example:\n\n``` php\nclass MacGuffin {\n    public static function with_foos() {\n        return static::with('foos');\n    }\n\n    public static function where_bar() {\n        return static::where('bar', '=', MAGIC_NUMBER);\n    }\n}\n\n// somewhere else:\nMacGuffin::with_foos(); // returns a Query, that doesn't have access to where_bar()!\n```\n\nNow we can use these methods in our controllers to hide more logic in the model. However if we want to fetch some macguffins with both conditions, we have no choice but to write it all out in the controller (dirty code) or create another method that combines both of these helpers (lots code duplication with a combinatorial amount of methods).\n\nIf this change is implemented, it would be trivial to create these methods as chainable by making them instance methods and prefixing them with an underscore:\n\n``` php\nclass MacGuffin {\n    public function _with_foos() {\n        return $this->with('foos');\n    }\n\n    public function _where_bar() {\n        return $this->where('bar', '=', MAGIC_NUMBER);\n    }\n\n    public function _for_index() {\n        return $this->with_foos()->where_bar()->paginate(); // No code duplication here!\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCurrently Eloquent use this approach internally for the `_with()` method, that's why i used the underscore-prefixed naming. \n\nIf there's fear of unexpected \"magic\" method calls, it might be a better idea to create an array with allowed methods, such as `public static $finder_methods = array('with_foos', 'where_bar');` (then the underscore prefix could be dropped as well), but it seemed that this goes better with Laravel's zero-config approach.\n",

(This includes `application`.) Additionally, a `(:bundle)/db/seeds` directory was added.\n\nIn the `seeds` directory, classes may be created to seed the database, like so:\n\n``` php\n\n<?php\n\n// file: application/db/seeds/roles.php\n\nclass Roles\n{\n    public function run()\n    {\n        // Insert roles, e.g.\n        Role::create(array('name' => 'admin', ...));\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nIf the seed is part of a bundle - in order to avoid naming conflicts - the class is prefixed by the bundle name, as with tasks. So, the `roles` seed of the `admin` bundle would look like this:\n\n``` php\n\n<?php\n\n// file: bundles/admin/db/seeds/roles.php\n\nclass Admin_Roles\n{\n    public function run()\n    {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nTo run all seeds for all bundles, `php artisan migrate:seed`. To run all seeds for the \"admin\" bundle, `php artisan migrate:seed admin`.\n",

The reason seems to be that the default 500 error state never actually calls the response's `render` method. This pull fixes that.\n\nNote: I think only the 500 event requires the `render` method be called. I added it to the 404 event to keep the code in sync.

Allow nested comments... not that you would ever need this, but it should prevent things from blowing up if you comment out a large chunk of code.\n2. Requires that **all** comments (including single-line) have a closing tag (`--}}`), which should help enforce some consistency amongst developers and avoid confusion with multi-line comments.\n\nThanks!\n",

        "body": "This feature allows developers the flexibility to use unix timestamps with their models instead of being confined to TIMESTAMP and DATETIME. The documentation has also been updated to explain how to use this functionality.\n#### Overview\n\nTo enable unix timestamps on your model simply add the following to your model:\n\n``` php\nclass User extends Eloquent {\n\n    public static $timestamps = true;\n\n    public static function created_at()\n    {\n        return time();\n    }\n\n    public static function updated_at()\n    {\n        return time();\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nThis feature also updated the Schema builder. You can now do the following:\n\n``` php\n$table->timestamps(true);\n$table->date('added_on', true);\n$table->timestamp('added_on', true);\n```\n\nThe above will create `INT(10) UNSIGNED` columns.\n#### Questions?\n\nIf you have any questions about this functionality please don't hesitate to ask.\n#### Additional Credit\n\nI would also like to give credit to @mikelbring for suggesting to use the static methods.\n\n> _PS:_ I'm not sure why the pull request is pulling in Phill's commit. I did a pull from upstream's develop before starting this feature branch.\n",

        "body": "Hi fellas,\n## Current Situation\n\nCurrently, the usage of `HTML::ul` and `HTML::ol` methods is like so:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n$list = array(\n    'first',\n    'second',\n    'third',\n    'fourth',\n);\n\necho HTML::ol($list);\n```\n\nI like that. It's nice and simple. It produces:\n\n``` html\n<ol>\n    <li>first</li>\n    <li>second</li>\n    <li>third</li>\n</ol>\n```\n\n---\n\nNesting lists is done like so:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n$list = array(\n    'first',\n    'second',\n    'third',\n    array(\n        'lorem',\n        'ipsum',\n    ),\n);\n\necho HTML::ol($list);\n```\n\nWhich produces:\n\n``` html\n<ol>\n    <li>first</li>\n    <li>second</li>\n    <li>third</li>\n    <ol>\n        <li>lorem</li>\n        <li>ipsum</li>\n    </ol>\n</ol>\n```\n## Proposal\n\nThis pull request enables the `HTML::listing` (the method that produces `HTML::ul` and `HTML::ol`) to display values for corresponding nested lists **in addition** to the already supported usage above. It doesn't touch the Laravel API and doesn't break backwards compatibility.\n\nYou might recognise this sort of stuff from typical navigation / dropdown menus:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n$list = array(\n    'first',\n    'second',\n    'third',\n    'fourth' => array(\n        'lorem',\n        'ipsum',\n    ),\n);\n\necho HTML::ol($list);\n```\n\nThe only difference between this and the examples before is that we now have a key for the `fourth` item. This produces the following hypertext markup:\n\n``` html\n<ol>\n    <li>first</li>\n    <li>second</li>\n    <li>third</li>\n    <li>\n        fourth\n        <ol>\n            <li>lorem</li>\n            <li>ipsum</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n```\n\n> Note: the list is only produced in this format if there is a key provided for the nested list array.\n\nThoughts on this?\n\nSigned-off-by: Ben Corlett bencorlett@me.com\n",

It's a simple change, that won't add a lot of extra overhead, but makes the routing of bundles a bit more flexible.\n\nA practical example would be when you have two separate blogs on your website (for example in different languages). They would both use the same blog bundle, but serve up different content based on the URI. With this addition you don't have to include a reference to 'blog' anymore like /blog/myfirstblog and /blog/mysecondblog. Instead you can simply configure multiple handles and use /myfirstblog and /mysecondblog directly. Looks a bit cleaner, I think.\n\nHope you like it :)\n",

Using `Event::first` returns the response of the first event, often `null`.  So instead use `Event::until` to get the first non-null response.\n2. If none of the events return a value then `Event::until` returns `$responses` (an empty array) - `null` makes more sense.\n3. Get Blade to return `null` instead of `false` if it can't handle the file, since Event watches for `null`, and `null` is what you get with no return too.  And updated View to check for `null` too.\n",

Even wrapping the expression in `DB::raw()` didn't matter because adding the table prefix (even if blank) cast the `Expression` back into a string, with undesirable results.\n\nThis patch makes sure that raw expressions are not prefixed. I suppose this will need to be noted in the documentation.\n",

        "body": "I say bug but it could be me doing it wrong. Let me do some explaining.\n\nThis isn't mentioned in the docs but it does say that module composers act just like the application composers, but I figured that because it's a module the composer should also have the module name prefixed to the view file. So if my view was **template** and it was located at **module/admin/views/template.php** then the composer should reference it like `'admin::template'` instead of just as `'template'`\n\nThat's all fine, I gave it a name and dynamically called it like `return View::of_template()` and it worked. So I set about added assets for my template but found none were showing up in the template.php file once rendered. So I bound a variable in the composer (and yes I did return the $view variable at the end) but kept getting undefined variable errors. I did a bit of debugging and found that the `static::$composers` property in the system/view.php file contained an array similar to this:\n\n```\nArray ( [admin] => Array ( [admin::template] => Array ( [name] => template [0] => Closure Object ( [parameter] => Array ( [$view] => ) ) ) ) ) 1\n```\n\nI also echo'd out the `$this->view` and `$this->module` properties and found that they contained the values **template** and **admin** respectively. So the if() statement in the compose() method was not succeeding because `static::$composers['admin']['template']` does not exist.\n\nSo in my 2 (unfortunately I forgot something) commits and 1 new line I simply check if we are not running under the application module, and if not prefix the module to the view so it can be called correctly.\n\nAgain, this could be me doing something wrong. Sorry for the long-winded post.\n\nRegards,\nJason.\n",

This could be for example a `.htaccess`-based authentication.\n\nI hope the changes are clean and up-to-par with your standards.\n\nThanks.\n",

This is an unnecessary step that we should do for the user.\n\nMy guess is that this wasn't done previously due to git's limitation\non empty directories. However by moving the git ignore file for the\napplication/config/local directory into local and making it ignore\nall but itself (the .gitignore file), we are able to get around this\nlimitation.\n# Additional Notes\n\nI think it would also be beneficial to set local as the default environment now that we can auto create the local directory. I think this would be keeping with the \"When starting a new project, you shouldn't be bombarded with loads of confusing configuration decisions\" statement. I think in it's current state people are still being confronted with too many confusing configuration decisions. The sooner we can get people from installed to using Laravel the better and by assuming they are starting out with local development we cut out an entire step that will be appropriate for the majority of people trying out Laravel for the first time.\n",
