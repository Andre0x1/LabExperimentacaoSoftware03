JavaScript Engine: I've added a video link by Brad Traversy, which provides valuable insights into how JavaScript engines work. \r\n> Video Link: [Brad Traversy - Understanding JavaScript Engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc6faXVc54E)\r\n2. Collection and Generators: I've added a video link to this topic, which helps learners understand Collection and Generators \r\n> Video Link: [Collection and Generators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcP039DYzmE).\r\n3. Clean Code: I've also added a video link that focuses on the importance of writing clean code.\r\n> Video Link: [Tips to write clean code - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wHyoBPc6zs) \r\n\r\nIn addition, I've noticed that the topics \"map, reduce, filter\" and \"Higher Order Functions\" seem to overlap, with the former being a sub-topic of the latter. As a suggestion, I recommend categorizing \"map, reduce, filter\" as a sub-topic under \"Higher Order Functions/Iterators\" for a more organized structure.\r\n\r\nPlease review and consider merging these changes to further enrich the repository's resources and improve the learning experience. Thank you!",

It emphasizes that `setTimeout()` does not guarantee that the callback method will be run exactly after a specified delay, which can lead to trust issues with this function.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the video addresses the intriguing scenario of `setTimeout()` with a 0-millisecond delay, a common interview topic that can be rather perplexing for inexperienced developers.\r\n\r\nLink to the video: [TRUST ISSUES with setTimeout() \u2014 Akshay Saini](https://youtu.be/nqsPmuicJJc?si=4FXKlZfqiJUqO2Y4)\r\n Could you please add the 'Hacktoberfest Accepted Label' to this , So I got eligible . \r\n  ",
