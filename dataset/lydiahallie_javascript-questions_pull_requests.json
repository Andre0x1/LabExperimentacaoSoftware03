Being a native speaker of Albanian language called (SHQIP - sq), I've noticed that our language wasn't supported in the current version of the project. To make this project more inclusive and accessible to the speakers of Kosova/Albania, I've decided to add localization support for my native language.\r\n\r\nIn this pull request, I have:\r\n\r\n1. Added Shqip translation files to the  directory.\r\n2. Updated the documentation to reflect this new language addition.\r\n\r\nI believe that adding Shqip to the list of supported languages will make this project even more useful to a wider audience. I look forward to your feedback and hope for the successful merger of this contribution. Please feel free to suggest any changes or improvements.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this request.",

        "body": "Fixed the question/answer and also covered the old question.\r\n\r\n\r\n###### 76. What's the output?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { firstName: myName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };\r\n\r\nconsole.log(firstName);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- A: `\"Lydia\"`\r\n- B: `\"myName\"`\r\n- C: `undefined`\r\n- D: `ReferenceError`\r\n\r\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n#### Answer: D\r\n\r\nBy using [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) syntax we can unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { firstName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };\r\n// ES5 version:\r\n// var firstName = { firstName: 'Lydia' }.firstName;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(firstName); // \"Lydia\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a property can be unpacked from an object and assigned to a variable with a different name than the object property:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { firstName: myName } = { firstName: 'Lydia' };\r\n// ES5 version:\r\n// var myName = { firstName: 'Lydia' }.firstName;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(myName); // \"Lydia\"\r\nconsole.log(firstName); // Uncaught ReferenceError: firstName is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, `firstName` does not exist as a variable, thus attempting to access its value will raise a `ReferenceError`.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Be aware of the `global scope` properties:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { name: myName } = { name: 'Lydia' };\r\n\r\nconsole.log(myName); // \"lydia\"\r\nconsole.log(name); // \"\" ---- Browsers e.g. Chrome\r\nconsole.log(name); // ReferenceError: name is not defined  ----- NodeJS\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever Javascript is unable to find a variable within the _current scope_, it climbs up the [Scope chain](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/ch3.md) and searches for it and if it reaches the top-level scope, aka **Global scope**, and still doesn't find it, it will throw a `ReferenceError`.\r\n\r\n- In **Browsers** such as _Chrome_, `name` is a _deprecated global scope property_. In this example, the code is running inside _global scope_ and there is no user defined local variable for `name`, therefore it searches the predefined _variables/properties_ in the global scope which is in case of browsers, it searches through `window` object and it will extract the [window.name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/name) value which is equal to an **empty string**.\r\n\r\n- In **NodeJS**, there is no such property on the `global` object, thus attempting to access a non-existent variable will raise a [ReferenceError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined).\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>",

There is a ReferenceError thrown in the code after trying to get a property of a non declared variable here. While the answer B is alright the explanation seems to forget to mention the fact that the error is thrown.\r\n\r\n###### 119. What's the output?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst person = {\r\n  firstName: 'Lydia',\r\n  lastName: 'Hallie',\r\n  pet: {\r\n    name: 'Mara',\r\n    breed: 'Dutch Tulip Hound',\r\n  },\r\n  getFullName() {\r\n    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nconsole.log(person.pet?.name);\r\nconsole.log(person.pet?.family?.name);\r\nconsole.log(person.getFullName?.());\r\nconsole.log(member.getLastName?.());\r\n```\r\n\r\n- A: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`\r\n- B: `Mara` `undefined` `Lydia Hallie` `ReferenceError`\r\n- C: `Mara` `null` `Lydia Hallie` `null`\r\n- D: `null` `ReferenceError` `null` `ReferenceError`\r\n\r\n<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n#### Answer: B\r\n\r\nWith the optional chaining operator `?.`, we no longer have to explicitly check whether the deeper nested values are valid or not. If we're trying to access a property on an `undefined` or `null` value (_nullish_), the expression short-circuits and returns `undefined`.\r\n\r\n`person.pet?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. It has a property called `name`, and returns `Mara`.\r\n`person.pet?.family?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. `pet` does _not_ have a property called `family`, `person.pet.family` is nullish. The expression returns `undefined`.\r\n`person.getFullName?.()`: `person` has a property named `getFullName`: `person.getFullName()` is not nullish and can get invoked, which returns `Lydia Hallie`.\r\n`member.getLastName?.()`: <s>`member` is not defined: `member.getLastName()` is nullish. The expression returns `undefined`. </s> variable `member` is non existent therefore a `ReferenceError` gets thrown!\r\n\r\n</p>",

So this sort of prevents them. \r\n-Prevents impostor syndrome. \r\n-Kinda forces them to rethink and re approach question thus further solidifying their javascript. \r\n\r\nNot all the hints are good and I'm sure you can come up with better hints.",
