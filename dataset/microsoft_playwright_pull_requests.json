        "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nWhen a language port was using Inspector with the \"Locator Picker\" feature, it only recognised JavaScript as a language by default. As a workaround the user was able to click record, interact with the page and then the language would be correctly used -> csharp e.g. would work in the \"Locator Picker\".\r\n\r\n**Why?**\r\n\r\nOur language bindings are setting `PW_LANG_NAME=<sdkLanguage>` env var -> good. Our recorder harness also uses this along its internal state here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/b9b289b6415515b1b8e1a2524ed6425c8992af5a/packages/playwright-core/src/server/recorder.ts#L369\r\n\r\nand it gets used here (no parameter means: we use the first language aka. primary language):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/b9b289b6415515b1b8e1a2524ed6425c8992af5a/packages/playwright-core/src/server/recorder.ts#L95\r\n\r\nThe only issue is that the Inspector frontend in the beginning does not know which language it should use and pass over to the server side, it then falls back to JavaScript.\r\n\r\n**Proposed fix**\r\n\r\nInstead of passing it over from the frontend to the server side, we just always use it from the server side, aka. \"currentLanguage\". When the user switches languages in the frontend, \"currentLanguage\" already gets updated properly via the \"fileChanged\" event.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/playwright-dotnet/issues/2718",

This makes sense when the report is output to stdio however it poses a problem when an output file is specified. When the report XML is saved to the specified outputFile, it becomes difficult/impossible to use the relative paths that are rendered for attachments. The attachment paths are relative to the configRoot but as a consumer of the JUnit report XML, we no longer have any knowledge of what the configRoot is. As a result, we have no way of finding those attachments.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the JUnit reporter to attempt to make attachment paths relative to the report output file whenever possible. If no output file is specified, then the previous behavior will be maintained.",

While this does look like a bug in Firefox itself, we failed to reproduce it in isolation.\r\n\r\nFor the reference, the following tests fail with the Firefox 116 (using `PWTEST_TRACE=1` triggers the race condition somewhere):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nPWTEST_TRACE=1 npm run ftest cli-codegen\r\n```",

Additionally, it takes a different approach to separating test and component code, which has some advantages over the current solution.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve prepared a short video introducing the idea (package name updated in this PR):\r\n\r\n <img width=\"1180\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/488689/05567abf-c9fe-4079-9965-2f80dfd78c69\">\r\n\r\n**[\ud83d\udc49 Watch the video here](https://youtu.be/IyYvZW93bnw)**\r\n\r\n\r\n~~This PR documents an integration into Playwright\u2019s installer and CLI which does not yet exist.

In the meantime, if you want to kick the tires, you should be able to set up a project manually with the instructions on the `@storybook/playwright-ct` [README](https://github.com/storybookjs/playwright-ct), which documents the current status/behavior.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR links to the `@storybook/playwright-ct` README to help Storybook / Webpack / Angular / etc. users learn about the project.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the PR is intended as a conversation starter and we are very open to iterating based on your feedback. I look forward to discussing and figuring out a path forward together!",

If you click on it, the actual screenshot is accepted and the button is changed to \"undo\".\r\n- Save buttons appear next to actual and expected attachments of a failed screenshot. Button is disabled if the click won't change anything (screenshot's already accepted)\r\n- If some screenshots are modified, corresponding tests are marked as modified in the test tree with yellow circle\r\n- A \"modified\" filter has been added\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nThis PR partially addresses #24310.\r\nIn short, it's highly inconvenient to switch between CLI mode and UI mode to accept screenshots. As of now, you can't interact with screenshots state in UI mode which makes its use very limited",

However, this does not play nicely with more advanced inner locators like `or` and `and`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst child = page.locator('input').or(page.locator('button'));\r\npage.locator('parent').locator(child);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne would expect the above to locate \"input or button\" inside a \"parent\". However, currently it locates \"input inside a parent\" or \"button\", because it's translated to `parent >> input >> internal:or=\"button\"`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we have to wrap inner locator into `internal:chain` and query it separately from the parent.\r\n\r\nFixes #23724.",

It will allow to configure the project more conveniently and in one place without the need to use environment variables. For backwards compatibility, I didn't delete env vars and give them the highest priority (to be able to redefine some options in CI for example).\r\n\r\n### What problems does it solve\r\n\r\n- can't launch several chromium with different capabilities (each browser use the same `SELENIUM_REMOTE_CAPABILITIES`);\r\n- using environment variables is not convenient, especially if you need to pass objects.\r\n",

        "body": "As discussed in #23514, here's the PR for **playwright-crx**, a version of playwright that can run in a chrome extension service worker.\r\n\r\nFor that, it relies on `chrome.debugger.sendCommand` / `chrome.debugger.onEvent` to implement the `ConnectionTransport` interface.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nIt's possible to use `@playwright/experimental-crx` as a library to create new chrome extensions.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example of a background service worker for a chrome extension using **playwright-crx**:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { _crx } from '@playwright/experimental-crx';\r\n\r\nconst crxPromise = _crx.start({ slowMo: 500 });\r\n\r\nchrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async ({ id: tabId }) => {\r\n  const crx = await crxPromise;\r\n\r\n  // tries to connect to the active tab, or creates a new one\r\n  const page = await crx.attach(tabId!).catch(() => crx.newPage());\r\n\r\n  await page.goto('https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/#/');\r\n  await page.getByPlaceholder('What needs to be done?').click();\r\n  await page.getByPlaceholder('What needs to be done?').fill('Hello World!');\r\n  await page.getByPlaceholder('What needs to be done?').press('Enter');\r\n\r\n  // page stays open, but no longer controlled by playwright\r\n  await crx.detach(page);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more complete example can be found in `example/todomvc-crx`.\r\n\r\n### API Tests\r\n\r\nMost of **playwright-crx** tests run in a chrome extension found in `tests/crx/test-extension`.\r\nIts background service worker receives a serialized test method with some fixtures (limited at the time, see `crxFixtureRunner.ts`) and runs it.\r\n\r\nTo run tests in `crx` mode, I created a new npm script: `npm run xtest`.\r\n\r\nEven with several limitations (it's similar to `page.evaluate`), it already passes more than 1k tests.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is something that requires a big improvement:\r\n\r\n- tests won't run if a function or variable is declared outside the test function\r\n- tests run slowly because it needs to relaunch a new persistent context with our testing chrome extension for each test\r\n- fixtures are very limited at the moment\r\n\r\n## Recorder\r\n\r\nI decided to integrate the recorder chrome extension into `packages/recorder`.\r\n\r\nThis way, the app will keep working as before, but it can now also be installed as a chrome extension.\r\n\r\nThe only change to the original app is just a content script for communication with the extension background service worker when it detects it's running in a chrome extension context.\r\n\r\nIn terms of chrome extension functionality, it provides:\r\n\r\n- [action button](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/action/) for attaching current tab into recorder (it opens the recorder if it's closed)\r\n- [context menu](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/contextMenus/) for the same purpose\r\n- pages must be explicitly attached to be recordable, except if they are opened from already attached pages\r\n- closing the recorder window will detach all pages and uninstall injected scripts (highlights and event listeners)\r\n\r\nHere's an updated video (the app I used to record the video has a bug with the mouse position):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/1374559/3c67d830-3eb2-48f5-b409-28354c101b87\r\n\r\n### Recorder Tests\r\n\r\nTests at `tests/library/inspector` also run against recorder as a chrome extension when in `crx` mode.\r\n\r\nIt launches a persistent context with our recorder chrome extension and then attach to its tab using a chrome playwright page.\r\n\r\nNote that it uses playwright chrome flavor and not crx flavor to automate these specific tests, but recorded instructions are captured by `crx`. See `inspectorTests.ts` for more details.\r\n\r\n## Library Bundles / Require\r\n\r\nMost of `require`s were replaced with corresponding `import`s, except playwright bundles. For those, I created a vite plugin to replace requires from corresponding `BundleImpl` with imports in compile time\r\n\r\nSee `packages/playwright-crx/vite.config.ts` for more details.\r\n\r\n## Shims\r\n\r\nFor **playwright-crx** to compile and run, I had to rely on shims / polyfills.\r\n\r\nHere is the list of current shim libraries it uses (declared in `packages/playwright-crx/package.json`):\r\n\r\n- [@isomorphic-git/lightning-fs](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/lightning-fs)\r\n- [assert](https://github.com/browserify/commonjs-assert)\r\n- [browserify-zlib](https://github.com/browserify/browserify-zlib)\r\n- [buffer](https://github.com/feross/buffer)\r\n- [crypto-browserify](https://github.com/browserify/crypto-browserify)\r\n- [events](https://github.com/browserify/events)\r\n- [https-browserify](https://github.com/substack/https-browserify) - unavailable\r\n- [os-browserify](https://github.com/CoderPuppy/os-browserify)\r\n- [path](https://github.com/jinder/path)\r\n- [process](https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-process)\r\n- [readable-stream](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream)\r\n- [setimmediate](https://github.com/yuzujs/setImmediate)\r\n- [stream-http](https://github.com/jhiesey/stream-http)\r\n- [url](https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-url)\r\n- [util](https://github.com/browserify/node-util)\r\n\r\nI also created some shims under `packages/playwright-crx/src/shims`, mostly with `noop` functions.\r\n\r\nRefs: #23514\r\n",

        "body": "Improve programmatic API of accessing the \"pick locator\" functionality as exposed by the playwright trace viewer/codegenerator.\r\n\r\nFixes #13900\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is the both the best way to implement it (sorry in advance, first time contributing here) nor the best API, so would love some feedback on both.\r\n\r\nOverall: it would be super helpful for us (octomind) to programmatically be able to pick the \"best\" locator/selector for a certain HTMLElement we have in-memory already. Our use-case is a little different than the one referenced in the issue: we want to be able to auto-generate playwright tests using some form of AI/smart exploration. To do that effectively we would like to be able to choose the \"best\" selector/locator for a certain element that we already hold in-memory from our exploration process so that the resulting test case is as robust as possible. \r\n\r\nIf you need more information we can go also go into more detail. We in general would love to help give playwright a programmatic API if allowed , e.g. test execution and introspection of test results is something we are very interested in as well (see https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/7275).\r\n\r\nRe: this specific change: I was looking to build an API that works on a certain HTMLElement directly, but found it a) difficult to get that through the serialization between client/server and b) thought that a selector -> \"better\" selector API might be more generic anyways.\r\n\r\n",

Later on the merge workflow uploads that blob report to Azure blob storage.\r\n  - Workflows triggered by `push` event can read secrets.

So I implemented `SELENIUM_WS_ENDPOINT` env variable to specify selenoid ws endpoint (looks like - `ws://selenoid.example.com:4444/devtools/<session-id>`). Moreover env variable `SELENIUM_WS_ENDPOINT` can be used for another selen-projects which not support `se:cdp` capability.\r\n\r\nMore info about selenoid here - https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/",

Are there other ways to make them focused other than `only`?\r\n\r\n- Explain why we're even in focused mode and how to control it\r\n\r\n  The default scaffolded Playwright config file includes a forbidMode expression driven by whether `CI=1` is set.\r\n  I ran into this when trying to reproduce a CI issue locally so I had it set and unknowingly entered focus only mode.\r\n  I wasn't aware this mode was a thing because I was using the default configuration from `npm init` and did not familiarize myself with all the options in it.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to tell if we're in a TypeScript or JavaScript project in this function? I would use that to display the configuration file name with the right extension.",

Its prerelease versions have been thoroughly tested by a wide number of users, and I think it's finally ready for &quot;actual&quot; release, for use in the mythical &quot;production&quot;.</p>\n<p>The breaking changes introduced here are mostly originating from the v1 CST parser having become a rather difficult beast to work with. So it's here rewritten pretty much completely, now with a lexer as a first stage. Along the way, the whole project was rewritten in TypeScript and the export paths and options refactored pretty deeply.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Playwright currently has hardcoded chrome args stored at `packages/playwright-core/src/server/chromium/chromiumSwitches.ts`. This PR exports two vars, one for android and one for desktop sessions.\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes the above mentioned issue and has been verified locally with chrome v111 and older chrome versions such as v108 and v96 (where `--disable-sync` arg was working).",

This makes\r\n  sure that all `runCLI.waitFor()` commands actually wait until the necessary\r\n  output.\r\n- for a handful of tests that do actually want to auto-close codegen,\r\n  introduce an optional `autoCloseWhen` flag for the `runCLI` fixture\r\n  that makes sure to close the codegen once a certain output was reached.\r\n",

While React now recommends using `Vite` instead of `Create React App` to bootstrap projects.

I use it on different projects and it's very powerful.\n\n### Short description\n\nThis PR allows to configure output video quality on Chromium.\n\n### Background\n\nRecently, I tried to generate videos based on HTML5 animation. I tried to use playwright to generate the video but unfortunately, the quality is not sufficient.\n\nI also plan to use playwright to generate \"support\" videos for a product knowledge base.\n\n### Use cases\n\n- Generate videos from HTML5 animation\n- Automate \"how-to\" videos\n- Automate \"demonstration\" videos\n- Reduce quality when recording tests\n\n### Additional notes\n\n- This feature is only available for Chromium. It's OK for my use case but maybe we can add it on other platforms.\n\n- It's my first PR on playwright. Do not hesitate to tell me if everything is correct.",

But the process was never exiting. Reasoning unclear, most likely some bug, but should be fixed separately imo.\r\n3. This ended up in a `Test finished within timeout of 30000ms, but tearing down \"runCLI\" ran out of time. Please allow more time for the test, since teardown is attributed towards the test timeout budget.` error\r\n\r\nHow to fix? Still wait for the CLI process to exit, race against a timeout tho, if the process was not exited afterwards kill the process (to cleanup) and throw an Error that there was a leaking process.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/21654",

This is actually what the documentation claims will happen right now, but it's incorrect. I chose this solution over not following the redirect, since it makes sense, in my opinion, and not following the redirect would require more code changes (`httpRequest` would need some kind of option that prevents it from following redirects). But if that solution would be preferred, I am happy to change the implementation.",

        "body": "Close https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/10437.\r\n\r\nThis feature aims to bring official support to combine sharded reports in the HTML reporter. This is probably not the best solution, but I think it works with minimal changes.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\n1. We inline the `shard` config into a global variable along with other metadata for future usage called `window.playwrightMetadata`.\r\n2. Instead of inlining the ZIP file into a base64 string, we write the ZIP into a `report.zip` file. If there's sharding, we instead write them into a `report-{shardIndex}.zip` file.\r\n3. After each run, we typically upload the generated report directory somewhere to an artifact. Once every part is finished, we download and extract them to a single place. Everything except for the `report-{shardIndex}.zip` files should be overridden and replaced.\r\n4. In the web app, instead of reading the ZIP from a base64 string, we read them from HTTP. If there's sharding, we read the reports one by one and merge them together.\r\n\r\n## Comparing to [`playwright-merge-html-reports`](https://github.com/Rippling/playwright-merge-html-reports)\r\n\r\nThe `mergeStats` helper is largely inspired by `playwright-merge-html-reports`, but I think this approach has some advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Official support.\r\n2. No extra steps are needed, no need to run another script to combine the reports. This can be tedious for CI as they have to initialize an environment, npm install, download reports, run the scripts, then finally upload the report.\r\n3. Works out of the box, no need for another API.\r\n\r\n## Example setup\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions with artifacts\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nsteps:\r\n  playwright:\r\n    name: 'Playwright Tests - ${{ matrix.project }} - Shard ${{ matrix.shardIndex }} of ${{ matrix.shardTotal }}'\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    container:\r\n      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.29.0-focal\r\n    strategy:\r\n      fail-fast: false\r\n      matrix:\r\n        project: [chromium, webkit]\r\n        shardIndex: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\r\n        shardTotal: [10]\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\r\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\r\n        with:\r\n          node-version: '18'\r\n      - name: Install dependencies\r\n        run: npm ci\r\n      - name: Run your tests\r\n        run: npx playwright test --project=${{ matrix.project }} --shard=${{ matrix.shardIndex }}/${{ matrix.shardTotal }}\r\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\r\n        with:\r\n          name: playwright-report\r\n          path: playwright-report\r\n```\r\n\r\nWDYT? Once we're happy with the approach we can start writing some docs and tests.",

If the [CIE94] metric is less then 1.0, then we consider these pixels\r\n   **EQUAL**. (The value `1.0` is the [just-noticeable difference] for\r\n   [CIE94].). Otherwise, proceed to next step.\r\n1. If all the 8 neighbors of the first pixel match its color, or\r\n   if the 8 neighbors of the second pixel match its color, then these\r\n   pixels are **DIFFERENT**. (In case of anti-aliasing, some of the\r\n   direct neighbors have to be blended up or down.) Otherwise, proceed\r\n   to next step.\r\n1. If SSIM in some locality around the different pixels is more than\r\n   0.99, then consider this pixels to be **EQUAL**. Otherwise, mark them\r\n   as **DIFFERENT**.

        "body": "Vue router and probably others are not aware that playwright opens the page in a subfolder/url. So when a page is rendered, Vue router doesn't know what the url is and will throw a page not found.\r\n\r\nUsually this can be resolved by specifying a base url with the subfolder/url included. For example trough [`createWebHistory`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/17767/files#diff-cd3339bf4bd46b9793e091c73ef565d763439eae202bb579ba22626667d62e6cR6). \r\n\r\nHowever it's quite annoying to set this base URL including subfolder for the tests only with environment variables. Hence why i think it would be easier if playwright doesn't open the page in a subfolder/url.\r\n\r\n**Warning**: this is will be a breaking change\r\n       1. The url is changed from http://localhost:3100/playwright/index.html to http://localhost:3100\r\n<s>2. The imports in `/playwright/index.html` doesn't need to include `/playwright` subfolder any more. `<script type=\"module\" src=\"/playwright/index.js\" />` is now: `<script type=\"module\" src=\"/index.js\" />`</s>\r\n",

With this env, playwright server will auto-close when the network tethering client disconnects. It will also auto-close if the network client does not connect to the server in the first 10 seconds of the server existence. This way we can ensure that `npx playwright docker start` blocks terminal & controls the lifetime of the started container.",

        "body": "Suddenly, my CLI stopped working when provided a file path on windows in `npx playwright test c:\\foo\\bar\\123`. I tracked it down, that the cli runner forces a path to become a regex, if a string is given. But, for whatever reason (I don't see any relevant change here since a long time), this stopped working. If a path contains a backslash (so on windows), the regex never match, because a backslash need to be double escaped. Especially when you have number as filename in your path, it get's weird. Example: `c:\\foo\\bar\\3rdparty` will become `c:\\foo\\bar\\x03rdparty` in the regex, without escaping.\r\n\r\nThis change fix this behaviour.\r\nAlso this works when providing already escaped backslashes in path.\r\n\r\nHere is the regex test for it: https://regex101.com/r/W5QO7Q/2\r\n\r\nI don't see why this has ever worked before, but maybe a TS compiler change or a NodeJs change in a recent version (i am on 16.17.0 now) caused this regex to no longer work.",

        "body": "Fix for: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/17469\r\n\r\nAccording to `ts-node` `TS_NODE_PROJECT` is a path to the `tsconfig file`.\r\nI guess `path` could be either a `directory` or a `file`. \r\nI can't really assume the intention of the implementer. There are three different scenarios: provide `relative` or `absolute` path including a `filename`, a `relative` or `absolute` path without `filename`, or just a `filename`.\r\n\r\n1. If `TS_NODE_PROJECT` is set to a `relative` or `absolute` path including `filename`\r\nExample: `./path/tsconfig.custom.json` or `/absolute/path/tsconfig.custom.json`\r\nMy assumption here would be to always use `process.cwd()` for the `relative` path instead of `cwd` and NOT walk the tree. If I have provided a specific config file maybe it's best to throw an error? If it just silently fails or fallback to another one, we might think it's working even though it doesn't. An alternative would be a `warning` and `fallback`. However, what would you look for? Any `config file` in the file structure? A `file` with the same name? Other `files` in the same `directory`.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport function tsConfigLoader({getEnv, cwd, loadSync = loadSyncDefault}: TsConfigLoaderParams): TsConfigLoaderResult {\r\n  const TS_NODE_PROJECT = getEnv(\"TS_NODE_PROJECT\");\r\n  const TS_NODE_BASEURL = getEnv(\"TS_NODE_BASEURL\");\r\n\r\n  // tsconfig.loadSync handles if TS_NODE_PROJECT is a file or directory\r\n  // and also overrides baseURL if TS_NODE_BASEURL is available.\r\n  const loadResult = loadSync(TS_NODE_PROJECT ? process.cwd() : cwd, TS_NODE_PROJECT, TS_NODE_BASEURL);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nfunction resolveConfigPath(cwd: string, filename?: string): string | undefined {\r\n  // We assume that just because a filename is provided the file exists. I'm not sure that's good.\r\n  if (filename) {\r\n    const absolutePath = fs.lstatSync(filename).isDirectory()\r\n      ? path.resolve(filename, \"./tsconfig.json\")\r\n      : path.resolve(cwd, filename);\r\n\r\n    if(absolutePath && fs.existsSync(absolutePath)) {\r\n      return absolutePath;\r\n    }\r\n    // If we throw we won't continue looking\r\n    throw new Error('tsconfig could not be found for the provided path.');\r\n    //or if we just show a warning we will continue walking the tree to find a config file at another path.\r\n    console.warn('tsconfig could not be found for the provided path.');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n   if (fs.statSync(cwd).isFile()) {\r\n    return path.resolve(cwd);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const configAbsolutePath = walkForTsConfig(cwd);\r\n  return configAbsolutePath ? path.resolve(configAbsolutePath) : undefined;\r\n```\r\nFor `absolute` paths, I don't know. Maybe it should just be treated as a `relative` path and use `process.cwd()`? \r\nSeems like a longshot that you would want something that is not `relative` to the `working directory`?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. If `TS_NODE_PROJECT` is set to a `relative` or `absolute` path excluding `filename` (not sure how common this really is)\r\nExample: `./path/` or `/absolute/path`\r\nIt this scenario we should also use `process.cwd()` to resolve the path and NOT walk the tree, but look for a config file named `tsconfig.json` in the provided `directory`. As with scenario one, if a config file is not found I would really like to know it. And either fail by throwing or give a warning and fallback. Fallback seems more intuitive here since we would just look walk the tree and look for a file named `tsconfig.json`\r\n\r\n3. If `TS_NODE_PROJECT` is set to only a `filename` (not sure how common this is either)\r\nExample: `tsconfig.custom.js`\r\nIn this scenario I would say we don't have to use the `process.cwd()`. I'm fine with using `cwd` and walk the tree until a file is found with that name. The only fallback I see here that makes sence if you don't want to throw an error is `tsconfig.json` in `process.cwd()` and then show a warning that the file `tsconfig.custom.js` could not be found.\r\n\r\nI don't see any harm in looking for a config file in the `cwd` compared to the `process.cwd()` when `TS_NODE_PROJECT` is NOT provided, or if you only provide a `filename`.\r\n\r\nAll these scenarios depend on how nice you guys want to be and how much responsibility would fall on the devs.\r\nThis is enough to fix my issue:\r\n```\r\nconst loadResult = loadSync(TS_NODE_PROJECT ? process.cwd() : cwd, TS_NODE_PROJECT, TS_NODE_BASEURL);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@dgozman: Thoughts?",

Also I'm not sure about naming (you already have a TestFileFilter). And some types could be done better. \r\n\r\nAlso we can introduce build-in filters like `by test name`, `by test tag`, `by annotation` etc.\r\n\r\nIf you OK in general, I'll be happy to continue my work on this\r\n\r\n### TestFilter:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface TestFilter {\r\n  /**\r\n   * @param test\r\n   */\r\n  include?(test: TestCase): boolean;\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * @param test\r\n   */\r\n  exclude?(test: TestCase): boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n\r\n1. Create a demo project using `npx playwright init`, select TypeScript\r\n2. Create a filter implementation `tests/TestIdFilter.ts`:\r\n    ```ts\r\n    import { TestCase, TestFilter } from '@playwright/test/reporter';\r\n    \r\n    export default class TestIdFilter implements TestFilter {\r\n    \r\n      include(test: TestCase): boolean {\r\n        return test.id === \"a30a6eba6312f6b87ea5-5f7f5d07b39c1f61c732\";\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n3. Add a `filters: [['TestIdFilter.ts']]` configuration option to `playwright.config.ts`\r\n\r\n",

However, the PR serves to allow us to concretely discuss a proposed solution, the general test strategy (which will apply regardless of the solution/API), articulate pros/cons/problems, etc. (The implementation is currently enough so that we can play around with the proposed public API to get a feel for it in the context of the use cases it attempts to solve.)\r\n\r\n## API Overview\r\n\r\nThis introduces a `projectSchedule?: string[][]` configuration option at the top-level, which can be used in combination with the already existing [`projects`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject) configuration option to guarantee which projects run in relation to others.\r\n\r\nUsing it looks something like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n      projects: [\r\n        { name: 'My Setup', testDir: './setup',  },\r\n        { name: 'Desktop', testDir: './desktop', use: devices['Desktop Chrome'] },\r\n        { name: 'Mobile', testDir: './mobile', use: devices['iPhone 11'] },\r\n        { name: 'My Teardown', testDir: './teardown', },\r\n      ],\r\n      projectSchedule: [\r\n        ['My Setup'],\r\n        ['Desktop', 'Mobile'],\r\n        ['My Teardown']\r\n      ],\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, this simply means: run all tests in the _My Setup_ project, when that's done run all the tests in _Desktop_ and _Mobile_ project in parallel, then run _My Teardown_ project.\r\n\r\n## Issues Addressed\r\n\r\n1.

API: less is more. It's much easier to explain and program than some [fancy DAG-based API](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/14895#issuecomment-1207665459)\r\n2. everything's just a test! we get config, tracing, retries, fixtures, etc. for free \u2014 no more trying to figure out how to use globalSetup/globalTeardown\r\n\r\n## Cons/Limitations/Questions\r\n\r\nWhen using `projectSchedule`:\r\n\r\n- cannot use `shard` option: if you're using the schedule, you can quasi-shard with the schedule itself\r\n- project names must be unique\r\n\r\nIn the above example, if I want to run _Desktop_ project, but not _Mobile_, how do we express this? Presumably we need to run _My Setup_ and _My Teardown_, too.\r\n\r\nWe're not exposing a full-featured DAG, so dependency expression is limited (I think for the better, for now \u2014 although we can do some really neat scheduling optimizations in the future with 1 timing run + the DAG).\r\n\r\nWe don't guarantee projects run on the same worker/process, so you can't, for instance, start a webserver in memory in _My Setup_ and kill it in _My Teardown_. Although, in this case you can just use the `webServer` config option, or write a PID in your setup, then read and kill that PID in your teardown.",

So far, the Accept header was not being sent at all, which should be semantically equivalent to sending `*/*`, according to [RFC 7231](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-5.3.2). However, there are some web servers that handle this differently. Most notably, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)'s server just returns a 404 if the `Accept` header is missing from the request. I created https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/9520 in order to address the issue on their side, but I think it's also fine to just add the header here, which is why I created this PR.",

It doesn't happen in Ubuntu 20.04 neither in Debian Stable bot which features GCC8.3. Ubuntu 18.04 featuers GCC8.4. I attempted to build libpas and bmalloc with -fPIC as the build error indicates but it didn't fix the build error. Eventually I decided to partially revert 252977@main.\r\n  * Upstream bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243535",

The legacy one is caused by some internal Next.js components which [still use the legacy APIs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/122899bd37c70e12e6ac3d9503931bd0d4ac424b/packages/next/client/index.tsx#L566-L572).\r\n\r\nOne fix is to set the `__NEXT_REACT_ROOT=1` environment variable, but given it seems to be a hidden setting I think it wouldn't hurt to implement the fix in this PR regardless, which just involves preferring React 18 roots when available (rather than the other way around).",

Once we're satisfied with the js version, I'll send a PR in microsoft/playwright.dev to add this to the sidebar and start working on a separate PR to create a similar guide for java based on Deque's `com.deque.html.axe-core:playwright` package.\r\n\r\nThe other similar docs I was using as examples were mixed about whether to provide just js-js example code vs both js-js and js-ts. In this initial commit, I've included only js-js where the code would be identical between the two, and both when there would be notable differences (particularly, the examples that include import vs require differences, and the custom fixture example where the js-ts version includes typings).\r\n\r\nPer `CONTRIBUTING.md`, I verified that `npm run doc` passes without issue.\r\n",

libraries `webrtc` and `boringssl`. I inspected several commits and found out the linking error started happening since this commit https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=240755\r\n\r\nThis patch fixed a linking error in non-unified builds. The patch reintroduced a CMake setting that had created some problems in the past (there's a lof of discussion in the bug ticket about whether to enable this setting or not). The setting is `set(WebCore_LIBRARY_TYPE OBJECT)`. My understanding is that this change makes WebCore be built as dynamic library instead of statically.\r\n\r\nI didn't manage to reproduce this linking error upstream.\r\n\r\nTo solve the linking error I enforced linking to pthread. Probably this is not the right fix and there's a better way to fix it than introducing a change in Options{GTK,WPE}.cmake.\r\n\r\nAbout the tests, I got the following failures:\r\n\r\n```\t\r\n[webkit] \u203a library/browsercontext-locale.spec.ts:31:1 \u203a should affect navigator.language =======\r\n[webkit] \u203a library/browsercontext-locale.spec.ts:89:1 \u203a should affect navigator.language in popups \r\n[webkit] \u203a library/browsercontext-locale.spec.ts:141:1 \u203a should not change default locale in another context \r\n[webkit] \u203a library/defaultbrowsercontext-2.spec.ts:60:1 \u203a should support locale option =========\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese tests have been failing since #1649. They started failing due to [fast/text/international/system-language/navigator-language/navigator-language-fr.html is a flaky failure](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=240104). It seems to me these tests need to get their expectations updated after that change.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[webkit] \u203a library/modernizr.spec.ts:32:1 \u203a safari-14-1 ========================================\r\n[webkit] \u203a library/modernizr.spec.ts:74:1 \u203a mobile-safari-14-1 =================================\r\n```\r\n\r\nLikely a regression introduced by [Stop exposing ApplicationCache API if it is not enabled](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=241000). Probably can be fixed by updating expectations or enabling this setting.",

The Plugin implementation differs in logging: logs will _**NOT**_ be captured to reporters; they are just dumped to stdout/stderr depending on the log-level enabled (via `DEBUG=pw:webserver`).\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// @filename:playwright.config.ts\r\n      const { webServer } = require('@playwright/test');\r\n      module.exports = {\r\n        plugins: [\r\n            webServer({\r\n                command: 'node ${JSON.stringify(path.join(__dirname, 'assets', 'simple-server.js'))} ${port}',\r\n                port: ${port},\r\n            }),\r\n            webServer({\r\n                command: 'node ${JSON.stringify(path.join(__dirname, 'assets', 'simple-server.js'))} ${port2}',\r\n                port: ${port3},\r\n            }),\r\n        ],\r\n      };\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer-discussion, for this first pass we've decided to punt on:\r\n- captured logging: we likely need to put the plugins in their own process to do this properly\r\n- configure hook: there are too many initial open questions from an earlier commit we'd like to think through (e.g. do we mutate or not? when does it run? what can be changed? etc.)\r\n\r\nRelates #13362\r\nRelates #8206",

It's analogous to TestInfo, but at the global level.\r\n\r\nThe API is kept as small as possible for now.\r\n\r\nSome changes to note:\r\n- GlobalInfo is available to user's globalSetup; it's **not** available in globalTeardown\r\n- `async GlobalInfo.attach(\u2026)` is backed by a similar impl. to `async TestInfo.attach(\u2026)`, and is preferred over pushing directly onto the attachments array.\r\n- We no longer have FullConfig.attachments\r\n- The HTML Reporter CI plugin has been migrated to use this new API\r\n- The attachments are available in Reporters (read-only-ish), via the root suite\r\n- Many of our reporters don't expose the root Suite, so attachments are promoted to a top-level field\r\n- Global attachments use a throwaway directory that re-uses our existing directory structure; however, project level overrides are NOT respected \r\n- This API is not currently documented; let's continue dogfooding it and decide if we want to release it publicly.",

        "body": "In several of the Playwright APIs, falsey values were not handled correctly. This changeset adds tests (and some fixes):\r\n\r\n1. `route.continue`: If `options.postData` was the empty string, the `continue` failed to override the post data.\r\n2. `page.post` (`application/json` with `options.data: false|''|0|null`): Raw falsey values were getting dropped (i.e. you can't do the equivalent of `curl --header application/json \u2026 -d 'false'`). This has been fixed with most values across all browsers, but an additional fix is needed for `'null'` which the channel serializer treats extra specially.\r\n3. `testInfo.attach`: This didn't get reported as an error when `options.path` was the empty string, but should have been.\r\n\r\n#11413 (and its fix #11414) inspired this search as they are the same\r\nclass of bug.\r\n\r\nUnlike #11413, this set was programmatically found with static analysis (ESLint's\r\n`strict-boolean-expressions`) + grep filtering + manual review.\r\n(Given JS conventions, that rule itself is too noisy to be useful on its\r\nown as most of it would be FPs from a functional point.)",

It works, but I never fully got to the root cause so a bug upstream may be required. It's unclear whether it's (1) in [`colors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors), (2) in [`ansi-to-html`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-to-html), or (3) Playwright's use of the two. Since the terminal output is correct, I suspect it is in `ansi-to-html`. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst colors = require(\"colors\");\r\nconst Convert = require('ansi-to-html');\r\nconst convert = new Convert();\r\n\r\n// original (strike incorrectly wraps everything in the HTML)\r\nconsole.log(convert.toHtml(colors.strikethrough(\"crossed out\") + ' ' + colors.red(\"red\")))\r\n// prints: <strike>crossed out <span style=\"color:#A00\">red<span style=\"color:#FFF\"></span></span></strike>\r\n\r\n// workaround\r\nconsole.log(convert.toHtml(colors.reset(colors.strikethrough(\"crossed out\")) + ' ' + colors.red(\"red\")))\r\n// prints: <strike>crossed out</strike> <span style=\"color:#A00\">red<span style=\"color:#FFF\"></span></span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #11116",

        "body": "Firefox requires a bunch of build tools (aka \"toolchains\") to be built.\r\nUntil recently, default MacOS clang (that comes with Xcode) was\r\nsufficient to compile firefox.\r\n\r\nHowever, Firefox 95 started to use WebAssembly: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/12/webassembly-and-back-again-fine-grained-sandboxing-in-firefox-95/\r\n\r\nThis yielded the following issues specific to MacOS (somehow builds complete successfully on other platforms):\r\n\r\n- Default MacOS clang that comes with XCode doesn't support WebAssembly: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/issues/172#issuecomment-772399153\r\n- Clang that comes from Homebrew is missing `libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32.a`: https://github.com/jedisct1/libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32.a/blob/79b9b39f9be950110d3a7d6f91d86074349d8302/README.md\r\n- Firefox also requires `wasi sysroot`\r\n\r\nNow, depending on which branch firefox checkout comes from\r\n(`mozilla-release` vs `mozilla-beta`), firefox build system **might** or\r\n**might not** be able to download all the required toolchains in the\r\n`$HOME/.mozbuild` folder:\r\n- `mozilla-beta` branch supports toolchain auto-download\r\n- `mozilla-release` **does not** support it yet: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1744197#c2\r\n\r\nThe recommended solution is to download toolchains using non-release\r\nfirefox branch, and then re-use these toolchains to compile firefox from\r\nrelease branch.\r\n\r\nThis patch does exactly this: relies on pre-downloaded toolchains for\r\nrelease firefox compilation. To re-use pre-downloaded toolchains, we set a\r\ncombination of `MOZ_AUTOMATION` and `MOZ_FETCH_DIR` environment\r\nvariables - this is the same approach that is used on the official\r\nFirefox CI (see `about:buildconfig` page in the stable firefox 95).\r\n\r\nThis almost works, but there's a catch: the `MOZ_AUTOMATION` environment\r\nvariable auto-adds (\"implies\") the `--enable-release` configuration\r\noption: https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/9e1cd985485c0e01c5faa9b5072a405b344ebde7/moz.configure#L162\r\n\r\nThe `--enable-release` is supposed to yield a better binary, and we want\r\nbuilds to be the same across platforms, so this patch adds this option\r\n**unconditionally on all platforms**.\r\n\r\nThe `--enable-release` is also more picky about the source code: for\r\nexample, it complains about unused return values. Browser changes in\r\nthis patch are addressing these.\r\n\r\nReferences #10759\r\n",

In general,\r\nthis behavior/workaround is okay. But when you start using CSS viewport\r\nunits like vh and vw, screenshots will look wrong. Consider the\r\nfollowing example:\r\n\r\nFor a viewport of size 800px, the div will render at 400px. But a\r\nPlaywright screenshot of a this page will show the div at 1000px. Of\r\ncourse, one could argue that you should probably use vh heights together\r\nwith a fixed max-height or vmax or similar (with the reasoning usually\r\nbeing something like \"people shouldn't assume viewports are always\r\nsmall\") but the fact is that there are tons of websites out there that\r\nuse viewport units and they all sort of look wrong in Playwright\r\nscreenshots.\r\n\r\nAt happo.io, we've been using Puppeteer for an extended period of time,\r\nand I've noticed that they don't have the same problem.

I first worked on making this\r\nopt-in, but after having things reviewed by @pavelfeldman we decided\r\nit's safe to rely on this flag whenever content doesn't fit inside the\r\nviewport.\r\n\r\nThis is a chromium only option.

In this case, we should retry the click as before.\r\n- **No risk**: There is still a possibility of mis-targeting with iframes shifting around,\r\nbecause we only intercept in the target frame. This behavior does not change.\r\n\r\nThere is an **opt-out** environment variable `PLAYWRIGHT_NO_LAYOUT_SHIFT_CHECK` that reverts to previous behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #6238.",

This makes it possible to test low-level IME related composition interactions.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  await page.focus('textarea');\r\n  await page.keyboard.imeSetComposition('\uff53', 1, 1);\r\n  await page.keyboard.imeSetComposition('\u3059', 1, 1);\r\n  await page.keyboard.imeSetComposition('\u3059\uff53', 2, 2);\r\n  await page.keyboard.imeSetComposition('\u3059\uff53\uff48', 3, 3);\r\n  await page.keyboard.imeSetComposition('\u3059\u3057', 2, 2);\r\n  await page.keyboard.insertText('\u3059\u3057');\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might be wondering what, what about triggering of keyboard events such as `keyboard.up`, `keyboard.press`, `keyboard.down` etc, Rather than couple this PR with other discussions (see https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/7659) I think this can be worked on separately. Having `imeSetComposition` available sooner will be invaluable right now and help inform us of the discussions around how key events should work, and what their API should be.",

While looking into doing something similar with Playwright, I realized the JSON reporter didn't expose the tags passed to a spec in the output (shy of still being in the title).\r\n\r\nWhen going complex user acceptance testing, being able to map from User Story -> Requirement -> Test is important, and using tags to identify the tests for that purpose is extremely beneficial. While we can add tags with playwright, they're *absent* in the JSON reporter's output shy of being in the title of the spec itself. \r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the reporter such that the spec serializer locates all tags by regex with word boundary, plops them into an array and then strips the preceding `@` since it's more of an identifier for a tag than the content of the tag. \r\n",

Also does the job, but is presumably unnecessarily specific.\r\n\r\nAdding:\r\n```\r\n    \"./build/types\": \"./build/types.d.ts\",\r\n    \"./build/*\": \"./build/*.js\"\r\n```\r\n... Is probably the right solution.\r\n(Bonus: this would also allow removing this existing line: `\"./build/utils\": \"./build/utils.js\",`)\r\n\r\nOpened a PR to make this change: https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/11816\r\n\r\nJust in case there is a better path forward, opening this draft PR to allow conversation to take place both here and in the `jest` PR. @mxschmitt, @pavelfeldman, thoughts?",

Same goes for WebKit Linux\r\n- We don't need to estimate response headers size if we have content-length header & transfer size\r\n\r\nI'd say we should carefully go over all of the scenarios and test them, probably expand 4 -> 12 tests.",

A server is running on a specific local host (e.g. 127.0.0.1) while the test assumes none (defaulting to `locahost`).\r\n2. A server is running that doesn't use `SO_REUSEADDR`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both causes by using a socket connection to test if the port is in use, instead of trying to start a server on the port. Funny enough this was exactly what the code was already doing _after_ starting the server, to check if it is up already.\r\n\r\nI still like the suggestion made to make the host configurable, but for other reasons, which is that it would indirectly set `baseURL` to meet the user's expectation better.",

Python is used as an example language and \"ffmpeg not installed\" as an example when trying to record video.\r\n\r\n1. Using Python and doing playwright.chromium.launch\r\n  - We pass `python` over to the driver via an env var\r\n  - Then the driver prints `playwright install` since its Python -> Python specific\r\n\r\n2. Using Python and doing playwright.chromium.connect\r\n  - The server can only be in Node.js (if we add launchServer support to the languages, we can also pass it via the env)\r\n  - In `src/browserServerImpl.ts` we don't pass a custom language, so it fallbacks to JavaScript\r\n  - Then the driver prints `npx playwright install ffmpeg`.\r\n  - The reasoning behind this is that the host can be different, 10km far away, so it does not bring value if we promote Python (a different language) there\r\n\r\n3. Using PlaywrightServer/Client\r\n  - The server again can only be JS, so I'm printing JS CLI commands\r\n  - Again it can be 10km far away\r\n \r\nSide notes:\r\n\r\n- I renamed sdkLanguage to cliLanguage, since its not the sdkLanguage anymore.\r\n- I didn't implement sdkLanguage over WS http headers which would be the right way to do it, since we currently have no use-case for it.",

Before, we did report `onTestBegin`, but not `onTestEnd`.\r\n- List reporter aligned between \"running\" and \"finished\" state - it was one character misplaced.\r\n- Do not show the first 3 lines of test file when we cannot locate the error location in it - that's just noise.\r\n- Added a SIGINT test.\r\n\r\nFixes #7444.",

The immediate mitigation with `addInitScript` and adding a listener once does not work because `document.open()` resets listeners on `window` object.\r\n- **Risk:** `{ trial: true }` might dispatch move events like `mousemove` or `pointerout`, because we do actually move the mouse but prevent all other events.\r\n- **Timing**: The timing of \"hit target check\" has moved, so this may affect different web pages in different ways, for example expose more races. In this case, we should retry the click as before.\r\n- **No risk**: There is still a possibility of mistargeting with iframes shifting around, because we only intercept in the target frame.

        "body": "I found an issue with the `types.d.ts` file regarding `waitForSelector` when passing some options, but no state. When no `state` key is provided, the return type would include null. This is despite the default state value is `visible` and shouldn't allow `null`.\r\n\r\nI discovered when doing something like below. The example shows passing no options gives the correct return type, but not when options are passed.\r\n<img width=\"751\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-27 at 7 08 06 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7098/116327235-f2c19e00-a78b-11eb-9e85-a4662de6c23b.png\">\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Source Code</summary>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  const el = await page.waitForSelector(tid('document-viewer'), {\r\n    timeout: docLoadTimeout, // no state passed, should default to visible\r\n  })\r\n  await el.click() // Object is possible 'null'\r\n\r\n  const elNoOptions = await page.waitForSelector(tid('document-viewer'))\r\n  await elNoOptions.click()\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI found the solution, added some tests, but I also fixed the `canBeNull` assertion because my new test case wouldn't fail the tests as they were (even though the types clearly included null, but the assertion was missing it.) Looking at some [code review comments this might have been the case for a while](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/1166#discussion_r391294546). If anyone has some insight, I'd love to hear it.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Browser registry is responsible for 3 things:\r\n1. Remove downloaded browsers if there are no packages that refer to them\r\n2. Install default browsers needed for the current package\r\n3. Install browsers on-demand when used through Playwright CLI\r\n\r\nCurrently, registry relies on a single \"download\" field in `browsers.json`\r\nto carry both (1) and (2). However, browsers in (3) are marked as\r\n`download: false` so that they aren't installed automatically in (2), so\r\nauto-remove procedure in (1) removes them on subsequent installation.\r\n\r\nOne possible approach to fix this would be modifying package's `browsers.json` to\r\nchange `download: false` to `true` when browsers are installed with\r\nPlaywright CLI. This approach was explored here:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/bc04a51800d6d6322e43b7d147fc0ec42181e084\r\n\r\nWe decided against this since we have a history of issues related to\r\npackage modifications after NPM installation. This breaks all\r\nsorts of yarn/npm caching mechanisms.\r\n\r\nInstead, this patch is a two-step refactor:\r\n- remove the \"download\" field in `browsers.json`. Now, all registries\r\n(including old ones from previously-released versions) will retain any\r\nbrowsers that are mentioned in the `browsers.json`.\r\n- add a new flag \"installByDefault\", that is **only used** for default\r\ninstallation.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the registry tasks are done like this:\r\n- (1) auto-removal: if browser has a back reference, it is retained,\r\notherwise it is removed from registry\r\n- (2) default installation: use only `installByDefault` to carry default installations\r\n- (3) CLI installation: simply installs browsers. Since we retain\r\neverythings that's referenced in (1), browsers aren't removed.\r\n\r\nFixes #5902",

This\r\nbrowser is a clone of Webkit r1443 that is the last known revision\r\nto compile on Mac 10.14.\r\n\r\nAs we move on, we're free to modify this browser however we want,\r\nbackporting important patches.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n1. The `deprecated-webkit-mac-10.14` also forks the original `build.sh`, `clean.sh` and `archive.sh`.\r\n    This way we're free to evolve `webkit` infra as we'd like.\r\n2. The infra in the `deprecated-webkit-mac-10.14` includes all the code to compile the webkit on other\r\n    platforms as well. This is not used atm, but might come handy in future for e.g. debugging. It also helps\r\n    avoid unnecessary code modifications while preparing this patch\r\n\r\nReferences #5833",

        "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nThe `playwright` library uses patched browsers' binaries that are not working with [nix] because the host requirements might not be satisfied. \r\n\r\nA way to make them work with nix is to create a nix [derivation] that wraps provided binaries within their dependencies and provides them already available by a path to a folder, so it's easy to point to them by using the `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` env variable. That means nix cares about the browsers' dependencies on its own. Hence, it doesn't make sense to validate host requirements on the `playwright` library level in this case. \r\n\r\nHowever, the library [validates host's requirements](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/master/src/server/browserType.ts#L180-L181) in such cases, which leads to a failure even when the binaries are fully operational (since they wrapped with nix) but the host requirements defined in the library are not satisfied.\r\n\r\n### In this PR\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a condition to allow skipping host requirements validation by providing boolean `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_VALIDATE_HOST_REQUIREMENTS` env variable. \r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nIn `shell.nix`\r\n\r\n```nix\r\n{ nixpkgs }:\r\n\r\nwith nixpkgs;\r\n\r\nlet\r\n  playwright-browsers = callPackage ./playwright-browsers/default.nix { };\r\nin stdenv.mkDerivation {\r\n  name = \"codeceptjs-testing-env\";\r\n  # ...\r\n  PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH = playwright-browsers;\r\n  PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_VALIDATE_HOST_REQUIREMENTS = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nix-shell --pure ./shell.nix\r\n[nix-shell:/workdir/web]# $PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH/chromium-844399/chrome-linux/chrome --version\r\nChromium 90.0.4392.0\r\n[nix-shell:/workdir/web]# node\r\nWelcome to Node.js v12.16.1.\r\nType \".help\" for more information.\r\n> const playwright = require('playwright');\r\nundefined\r\n> const browser = playwright.chromium.launch();\r\nundefined\r\n> \r\nSkipping host requirements validation logic because `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_VALIDATE_HOST_REQUIREMENTS` env variable is set.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[nix]: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/introduction.html\r\n[derivation]: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/expressions/derivations.html",

The event listener needs to be added on all documents, but only for chromium and only when a dragging input event is created. Making injectedScript browser-aware was not trivial, and sending a message to every injected script in every document adds a lot of complexity and race potential.\r\n\r\n# Upstream Work\r\n\r\nI believe 95% of this code can be replaced with an easy to land chromium patch. I wasn't able to get it ready today, but it adds a new event `Input.dragCaptured` and new methods `Input.enable`, `Input.disable`, `Input.dipsatchDragEvent`. This would reduce or userland code to be just an event listener that checks if the mouse event generated a dragStart, so we know whether to wait for it.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would use the same strategy for drag n drop in chromium as in other browsers. That is have Input.dispatchMouseEvent capture and resend any drags it creates and make no protocol changes. But doing that in chromium proved very difficult because synchronizing the mouse acks and drag messages is a pretty scary change.",

I rolled back my changes to that made resources to work so that this patch is more approachable.\r\n- The important edge cases that are needed for pixel perfect screenshots are not easy to add into the current snapshot format. I started to add focused node into the document, but doing so requires identifying nodes inside the serialized html. It's certainly doable, but its a lot of code so I left it out of this patch.

I can't imagine a situation where you want to pause but can't afford to have anything covering a small part of the screen. But maybe it would be a good explainer option.\r\n - Folio should disable timeouts when the user pauses the page, which implies that there should be an event emitted when a page is paused/resumed. Would other clients make use of this, or should we make it internal?\r\n - Maybe it should be `context.pause`? The ergonomics are kind of annoying for that, but since we are waiting in the node process we are likely pausing every page anyway.\r\n - I want to start codegen from within my pause ui.

As a symptom,\r\nwe get `applicationDidUnhide:` notification that does not happen when we create the window\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, we create the window too early, and there is some essential initialization\r\nthat happens after `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`. However, if we call\r\n`[NSApp activateIgnoringOtherApps:YES]` like we do in headful mode, everything works.\r\n\r\nThe only solution that worked so far is creating the first page after a timeout.",

One example is our own driver that had to keep track of all browsers to close them gracefully, and can just exit the process now.\r\n- Killing the node process with `SIGKILL` does not leave the browser running.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- One more wrapper process.\r\n- Protocol piping could be slower, although it was not measured.\r\n\r\nThe only scenario that leaves the zombie browser is when a) user sends a `SIGKILL` to the watchdog process and b) the browser misbehaves and does not close on pipe disconnect.\r\n\r\nFollow up:\r\nOnce we don't need compatibility with stock Chrome <= 88, we can stop sending `Browser.close` command and instead just close the pipe, since our browsers recognize that as a signal to close.\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n- Leave everything as is.\r\n- Remove the watchdog and hope that browser does not misbehave.\r\n- Just replace `Browser.close` with closing pipe in the future.\r\n",

        "body": "When closing a persistent browser context, we first close all of the pages, and then the browser itself. On windows (and Linux?) headful Chromium will close once all of its pages are closed. That is usually fine, because the subsequent `browser.close()` will be a no-op. However If one of the pages closes on its own while we are closing all pages, the browser will close prematurely. Then our attempts to close the page can be rejected with `Protocol error (Target.closeTarget): Target closed` because the browser will have closed.\r\n\r\nThis patch just adds a catch. I wasn't able to make a test to repro this with any consistency.\r\n\r\nAlternatively I think we can pass `--keep-alive-for-test` when launching chromium. Is this a breaking change though?\r\n\r\nThere are a few other cases where we throw errors when closing the page. See\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/924cc9894a89a75f89f9de20679c904a397d212f/src/server/page.ts#L380\r\nIt seems bad to throw an error because the page was already closed.

        "body": "Juggler code had a bug where we subscribed to window and tab\r\nevents, but did not iterate collections of current windows and tabs.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we were sometimes failing to set viewport size for the\r\ninitial window, and implemented an artificial promise to workaround\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nThis patch:\r\n- starts calling `onOpenWindow` and `onOpenTabListener` callbacks\r\n  for *all* windows and tabs - current and future, eliminating the\r\n  race condition.\r\n\r\nThis worked too well and we started overriding window sizes that\r\nwere set by users with `window.open(url, 'width=300;height=400')` (we\r\nhave a test for this). To fix this, we now plumb `CHROME_WITH_SIZE`\r\nflag from appWindow and override viewport iff this flag is not set.\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, we will use the `onTabOpened` event to move user\r\nagent emulation to the browser-side.\r\n\r\nReferences #3995",

Currently we call `installBrowsersWithProgressBar()` for installing the browsers which installs all the browsers since we have a full `browsers.json`, see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/blob/9c8ca93ae6e78209987f5545006de4272a500da0/driver/main.js#L26).\r\n\r\nMy idea was to have an optional CLI argument in the linked main.js which we pass to the function and acts as an allowlist. If none is specified no filtering will be made. Only if > 0 is passed filtering is applied.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a better API design for that, let me know. \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\ncc @dgozman ",

        "body": "This PR adds a variety of tests regarding clicking on links in iframes. Based on the numerous edge cases surfaced by these tests, I think it would be good to add more iframe click tests in some form or another. (These tests were authored in real-time as I was discovering more edge cases, so I'm very open to suggestions for improvement. \u2764\ufe0f )\r\n\r\nEDIT: With #3201 by @dgozman, the Chrome Headfull tests are now passing! \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n~~Many of the tests mark Chromium Head**full** as failing. In several of the failing Chromium Headfull failing cases, Playwright reports a click (i.e. we get past an `await button.click()`), but the click doesn't seem to actually happen (See `should click the visible link in an iframe (cross-origin)`.) In other cases, we timeout waiting for the click to complete and observe the following (repeated) log:~~\r\n\r\n```\r\n  pw:api retrying click action [] +0ms\r\n  pw:api   waiting for element to be visible, enabled and not moving [] +0ms\r\n  pw:api   element is visible, enabled and does not move [] +26ms\r\n  pw:api   scrolling into view if needed [] +0ms\r\n  pw:api   done scrolling [] +0ms\r\n  pw:api   checking that element receives pointer events at (35.32,17) [] +1ms\r\n  pw:api   element does not receive pointer events [] +6ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~See `should click the visible link in an iframe (cross-origin) in fixed position div` for an example of this happening.~~\r\n\r\nFinally, we get to the set of tests that deal with [`X-Frame-Options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) which is set to `DENY` to match the Wikipedia login link:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl -v 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Main+Page' 2>&1 | grep -i x-frame-options\r\n< x-frame-options: DENY\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these tests\u2014once we account for the clicking issues mentioned above\u2014we see inconsistent behavior. Assuming you run the following script:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst http = require(\"http\");\r\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\r\n  res.setHeader(\"Cache-Control\", \"no-store\");\r\n  console.log(req.url);\r\n  res.end(`\r\n    <body>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <iframe src=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" > </iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </body>\r\n  `);\r\n});\r\n\r\nserver.listen(3000);\r\n```\r\nIf you click _login_ in the iframe, the consumer-facing versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Webkit will all block the action and warn you in the console that `X-Frame-Options` is set to `'deny'`. However, in the Playwright versions of the browsers (as you'll see by the browser-specific passing criteria for the `should click and navigate to a x-frame-options:DENY link` test, Webkit and Chromium (Headless) give you the deny error, while Firefox navigates to the page against the policy set in the header. (Should Playwright-Firefox match the consumer Firefox behavior?) \r\n ",

The reason this is useful is to keep the window in place while debugging in the browser.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is unfortunately only possible in Chromium (and already is the only possibility with Firefox), because of differences between browsers:\r\n- Chromium - window is independent by default and set to fit viewport by playwright (this behavior is disabled by this PR with a flag)\r\n- Firefox - window is always independent of viewport; _there are WebDriver commands ([getWindowRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Commands/GetWindowRect)/[setWindowRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Commands/SetWindowRect)) or devTools protocol commands: [setWindowBounds](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Browser/#method-setWindowBounds), [getWindowBounds](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Browser/#method-getWindowBounds)) that might allow to align the behavior with Chromium, but I couldn't figure out how to call them (would be happy to contribute another PR with a little explanation of how to achieve that)_\r\n- WebKit - window is always bound to viewport\r\n\r\nCaveat about the tests - I wrote a test using `window.outerWidth/outerHeight`, however it seems that these properties only change when running chromium in `headless: false` mode. When running in headless these properties keep the original size and don't change to match the viewport size (even when calling `Browser.setWindowBounds`), so the new test is not checking anything and I didn't include it. Any suggestions on how to test would be great.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves #2749 \r\n",

Changes:\r\n- Grouped APT calls into a single APT call as discussed here: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/2656#issuecomment-647003569\r\n- Added Ubuntu (20 - focal) - latest LTS release of Ubuntu\r\n- Added Debian (10 - buster) - based on `node:12-buster-slim` a bit more lightweight, different and also common as a Docker base image. Needed also the custom `libjpeg` build, as proposed here: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2437#issuecomment-642860416.\r\n\r\nWith these the users, should be have more official Dockerfiles to get started with Playwright and see easier which dependencies are required in which Linux distribution (rather than just a list of deps in the docs).\r\n\r\nTested all of these three with Try Playwright locally, all of the browsers are working, making screenshots and interaction works.\r\n\r\nFollow up questions:\r\n- Maybe replace the `bionic` (Ubuntu 18) build to the `focal` (Ubuntu 20) build everywhere?\r\n- @arjun27 can we push them also to the Docker registry as soon as its merged?\r\n\r\nRelates to #3338",

This repository is eligible to try the new [GitHub Advanced Security code scanning](https://help.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/about-code-scanning) beta.\n\nCode scanning runs a static analysis tool called CodeQL which scans your code at build time to find any potential security issues. We've tuned the set of queries to be only the most severe, most precise issues. We'll show alerts in the security tab, and we'll show alerts for any net new vulnerabilities on pull requests as well. We've tried to make this super developer friendly, but we'd love your feedback as we work through the beta. \n\nIf you're interested in trying it out, you can merge this pull request to set up the Actions workflow. You can also get this set up yourself in any additional repositories in this organization by following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/enabling-code-scanning)",

This means that you no longer lose headers when calling `route.continue({headers: request.headers()})`.\r\n\r\nI couldn't get it to work when interception is off, because requests might be cached and never hit the browser process. We'd have to wait for responses to know if the request is cached. Even if we get a message with headers from the browser process, we cant trust it until we get a response event. It could be headers for a future redirect we haven't seen yet.\r\n\r\nFixes #1740",

They all had different pros and cons, and it was very difficult to settle on a good answer.\r\n\r\nFor now, let's not export any parameter/return types. We can whitelist some types upon user request. I'm thinking `LaunchOptions` and `AccessibilitySnapshot` could be quite useful. We can always add new types after 1.0, but we can't remove them.\r\n\r\nThe patch looks funny because this was my original intent for the types, but I didn't know I had to `export {}` to tell typescript that my .d.ts shouldn't export everything.",

In `playwright-core`, `playwright.chromium.executablePath()` returns `null` (same for firefox and webkit).\r\n- clients of `playwright-core` (e.g. `playwright` and others) download browsers one way or another.\r\nThey can then configure `playwright` with executable paths and re-export the `playwright` object to their clients.\r\n- `playwright`, `playwright-firefox`, `playwright-chromium` and `playwright-webkit` download \r\nbrowsers. Once browsers are downloaded, their executable paths are saved to a `.downloaded-browsers.json` file. This file is read in `playwright/index.js` to configure browser executable paths and re-export the API.\r\n- special case is `install-from-github.js` that also cleans up old browsers.\r\n",

I have some solid experience with other e2e frameworks and clicking on an animated element is one of the most annoying thing to tackle.\r\n\r\nIt happens that this is already handled out of the box by playwright! I made a quick proof test to validate it, hence I created this small PR.\r\n\r\nN.B.: I'd really love to contribute on fixing the aforementioned issue. Not sure though to fully get how the project wants to scope it. What I see as an issue is having e.g. a target you want to click on, hidden by some other animated `div` and then finally clickable.",

Things on my mind:\r\n\r\n- The Puppeteer comparison question in FAQs needs more work. Currently, it feels focused on the implementation and not on the value to users. To communicate that better, I'm wondering if we should have a basic list of features. This list of features could then be used for comparisons against other tools (Cypress/Selenium) or among browsers. I have a draft list of features below, but I would need your help for comprehensiveness. \r\n- Should we call out TypeScript as a differentiator with Puppeteer?\r\n- CI badges: they don't work right now, I'm expecting them to show the correct status when the GH workflows become public with the repo.\r\n- CI badges: our builds are failing, and it seems the issue is some rate limiting? Is there a way we could fix the build to pass before release?\r\n\r\nFeature list\r\n\r\n* Accessibility\r\n* Emulation\r\n* Input (mouse, keyboard)\r\n* Generating PDFs, screenshots\r\n* Geolocation\r\n* Code coverage and performance metrics\r\n",

We need these for basic keyboard functionality like ArrowUp and ArrowDown to work on WebKit for mac. For other browsers on mac, the same list can be used to enable better mac keyboard emulation.\r\n\r\nThe list was made by constructing NSEvents on a mac and seeing what selectors they triggered on an NSTextView. The conversion from NSEvents to DOM codes was done partially by hand as the code that does this conversion lives across many files in WebKit. There may be some errors or missing commands, but in general this should be a more faithful mac keyboard emulation than what we do in Chromium currently.\r\n\r\nNotably absent from the list are Cut, Copy, Paste, Paste Special, Select All, Undo, and Redo. They are handled in a slightly different way.",
