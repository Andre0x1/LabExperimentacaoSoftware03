If so, then we check the database instead of the default location.\r\n\r\nRight now this system has an issue where it'll reconnect to the database multiple times, which may cause performance issues. The point however is that this works, and that we can search the Atuin database.",

Not matching on explicit paths:\r\n\r\n* `+` Gives rule authors the ability to match only when an explicit path to the command is given\r\n* `-` Prevents rule authors from matching on a command regardless of what path was given (if any)\r\n\r\nSince the default behavior for `fuck` is to require user interaction before confirming a command, casting a wider net is unlikely to be harmful. \r\n\r\nAlso, the only rule that uses `@for_app` and has a path in the match string that I could find, has the path there because the most common invocation of that tool uses a path and the rule doesn't work otherwise, because of this limitation. In other words, it seems that the only rule that uses a path in the for_app string does so as a work-around to this too-strict behavior. I can only speculate that other rules, including the rm_dir rule, may have avoided the decorator for this reason.\r\n\r\nRule authors should not have to enumerate all the different paths a command could be called from, in my view. Hopefully this has not been litigated previously.\r\n\r\nBefore accepting, consider my commit message to d30a789. It may be better to strip paths in both places, but I'm not sure. Also if you need more tests, let me know where and I'll be happy to add them.",

In both uses of `get_pkgfile` (in pacman.py and in pacman_not_found.py), it would be appropriate for `get_pkgfile` to return an empty list when the `pkgfile` does not find any packages by the correct name. However, the `pkgfile` command returns 1 in these circumstances, and as such `subprocess` raises an exception. Now, when this exception is caused by `pkgfile` returning 1 with no output (when it finds no packages), `get_pkgfile` will not cause a crash.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce bug:\r\n```\r\nyaourt -S e\r\nfuck\r\n```\r\nthen press \u2191 or \u2193",

Therefore the\nfollowing conditions caused unexpected side effects:\n- memoize.disabled = True, key not yet memoized\n  \n  Having disabled the memoize function wrapper, the client expects\n  that no memoization happens. Instead the execution enters the\n  if clause and store the value into the 'memo' dictionary\n- memoize.disabled = True, key memoized\n  \n  Having disabled the memoize function wrapper, the client expects\n  that no memoization happens and the function will be evaluated\n  anyway, whether or not its return value had already been stored in\n  the 'memo' dictionary by a previous call. On the contrary, the last\n  statement of wrapper() access the value stored by the last function\n  execution.\n\nThis commit attempts to improve the function readability too.\n",

        "body": "This PR fixes a couple of limitations of the no_command rule:\n\n`/usr/lib/command-not-found` suggests commands from uninstalled packages, so we filter out commands that aren't installed. \n\nIn many cases taking the first installed suggestion is inappropriate -- for example, if the broken command is `bish`, on my system two of the suggestions are installed: `wish` and `bash`.  Which one did I mean?  We can guess by counting the number of occurrences in my shell history:\n\n``` sh\n\u279c  thefuck git:(improve-no-command) history | egrep '\\bbash\\b' | wc -l\n35\n\u279c  thefuck git:(improve-no-command) history | egrep '\\bwish\\b' | wc -l\n3\n```\n\nwhich tells us that I probably want `bash` (I don't even know what `wish` is, it's just in my history because I `which`ed it and `grep`ed for it a couple of times).\n\nI've updated the tests to check these cases and continue to work with the original cases.\n",
