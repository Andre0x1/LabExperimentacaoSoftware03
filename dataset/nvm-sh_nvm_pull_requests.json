        "body": "\r\nIn numerous blog posts regarding the configuration of the default nodejs version using nvm, the following command is often cited:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnvm alias default node\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this command might work in some cases (as `node` will point to the latest version installed on your system), it might not behave as intended if you want to default to a specific version of Node.js. \r\n\r\nThis command is actually referring to the [Set default node version](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/c6e35bae08ac4ea329c36aaaaf951b32a4612d80/README.md#set-default-node-version) section in the nvm's README. It's crucial to note that the instructions suggest setting a specific node version of your choosing, rather than using the generic `node`. \r\n\r\nSo if you're aiming to set a particular version (for example, 14.15.1) as your default, the correct command would be:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnvm alias default 14.15.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the specified version of Node.js will be used by default. If you simply use `node` as in the first command, it could point to any installed version, which might not be what you intend.",

That way it would step into the following code block and also fall back to `armv7l`.\r\n```\r\n  # If running a 64bit ARM kernel but a 32bit ARM userland,\r\n  # change ARCH to 32bit ARM (armv7l) if /sbin/init is 32bit executable\r\n  if [ \"$(uname)\" = \"Linux\" ] \\\r\n    && ( [ \"${NVM_ARCH}\" = arm64 ] || [ \"${NVM_ARCH}\" = armv8l ] ) \\\r\n    && [ \"$(command od -An -t x1 -j 4 -N 1 \"/sbin/init\" 2>/dev/null)\" = ' 01' ]\\\r\n  ; then\r\n    NVM_ARCH=armv7l\r\n    HOST_ARCH=armv7l\r\n  fi\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Instead of falling back to `armv7l`, create another if block to use `arm64`, something like\r\n```\r\n  if [ \"$(uname)\" = \"Linux\" ] \\\r\n    && [ \"${NVM_ARCH}\" = armv8l ] \\\r\n  ; then\r\n    NVM_ARCH=arm64\r\n    HOST_ARCH=arm64\r\n  fi\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions, feedback, or concerns!",

In either case, it does not append the `--strip-components=1` option, but rather uses the `-s` option to perform `ed(1)`-style basic regex replacement on the path.\r\n\r\nThis is tested to execute correctly on OpenBSD 7.0 (current release as of this PR). It does not address compilation issues of the downloaded `node` source code, as mentioned in #2134, which will likely require upstreaming of some subset of the OpenBSD-specific source patches that were developed for the OpenBSD ports build of `node` (see the OpenBSD patches for node-12.22.7 [here](https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/lang/node) or the implementation of binary builds for OpenBSD, but it does allow you to reach that step without error.

        "body": "TL;DR: `nvm install` fails in Arch's `makepkg` environment when `/sbin/init` does not exist. No idea (yet) why exactly this happens, but slightly modifying the line checking for `/sbin/init` here seems to fix things.\r\n\r\nA few more details/reasoning:\r\n\r\nIn some very rare circumstances, a non-existing `/sbin/init` seems to cause an `nvm install` to fail without any 'good' hint as to why it fails. (It seems like the commit 7f2ccd51d4c20cd23d7ba79e4c19f06c40b68470 made it especially hard to pinpoint what's going on here, because even if things silently fail there, it might still cause a script failure in those circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis could look like this, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDownloading and installing node v14.18.1...\r\nBinary download failed, trying source.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u2026and then nothing more.\r\n\r\nI am not entirely certain what exactly causes it to fail here \u2013 I'd (very broadly) assume that some \"globally\" set shell option from whatever called nvm might still cause the `ls` error to cause the nvm script to exit. I've originally come across it on Arch in `makechrootpkg`, although the main culprit seems to be in `makepkg` itself \u2013 which seems to be enough to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nBasically, it happens when running `makepkg` for a `PKGBUILD` where `nvm` is used (as, for example, recommended at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Node.js_package_guidelines#Using_nvm), when `/sbin/init` does not exist (on Arch it does not exist by default, but is provided by the `systemd-sysvcompat` package).\r\n\r\nI've only come across it by accident by building in a \"clean chroot\" (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot), where a package providing `/sbin/init` is not installed by default. The chroot environment itself does not seem to be relevant though (directly using `nvm` in it is possible) \u2013 it seems like it's only the `makepkg` environment that seems to matter.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, this \"had worked a few weeks ago\" \u2013 but I was not able to find out what had changed on Arch's end that might have caused this.\r\n\r\nI understand this is probably not really an `nvm` issue \u2013 I had just hoped that, with this being an easy fix (without any obvious downsides \u2013 to me at least), which shouldn't do much damage but just handles the non-existing file \"a bit more cleanly\", it might be easiest to address this here. Unless I can find out where things are _actually_ causing the issue in Arch's tools.\r\n",

        "body": "Changed configuration in **nvm_get_download_slug()** function, made condition for **darwin** based OS running on **arm64** arch i.e, **MAC M1**. \r\nIf so, then change HOST_ARCH to **x64** so that NVM will fetch **x64 arch** package from node repository which is the only package node currently having for darwin systems but no arm64 based packages\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\n- Macbook M1 ARM64 architecture problem that does not allow us to use default terminal for installing node packages using nvm, please [refer here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2350)\r\n- What we did was use a rosetta-2 terminal for installing different node versions using NVM. It was creating problems for automation developers who use scripts to run operations, and it was not always possible to run the script on a single installed version of the node.\r\n- Even by transforming the current shell to a different arch using rosetta2 e.g, **arch -x86_64 zsh** causing problems as it creates a new instance of the terminal that is indirectly equivalent to using a different terminal i.e, rosetta one, which stops execution of next series of commands if it is invoked inside the script\r\n\r\n#### Solutions Available\r\n- Use the latest version node as old ones were not built for mac m1 arch.\r\n- Use rosetta2 terminal to install node version as it converts architecture from arm64 to amd64, which then nvm install node packages for amd64\r\n- **Solution Provided by me** for automation engineers who don't want to switch on rosetta2 terminal just for installing node versions, Please [refer this](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2350#issuecomment-969947270). Complete consequences explained in detail\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n- Made changes in **nvm.sh** file to update **nvm_get_download_slug()** function that basically gathers architecture information regarding users system. \r\n- Basically **rosetta** was only being used to change architecture so that **nvm_get_download_slug()** would get **x86_64** instead of **arm64** architecture. Because older versions were never designed for **arm64** architectures.\r\n- This part was the pain and I added conditions for the same, so that if the device is apple-based with silicon chip then it will set \"x64\" arch. So that packages fetched from the nodejs repository will be installed properly.\r\n\r\n#### NVM working on mac m1 after making PR changes in nvm.sh\r\n![Problem solved after refreshing changes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77939876/142740986-9201de78-6d44-405d-b393-a7d7dab6df2b.png)\r\n- First I have run \"uname -a\" to show my mac m1 architecture\r\n- Then I am trying to install node 12.22.7 **nvm install 12.22.7** on arm64 arch. This throws me an error as the package was not found.\r\n- Then I sourced the RC file so that my changes in **nvm.sh** reflect in the shell. Whoop, this worked",

Unfortunately, I noticed a bug where it still prints out some messages in different cases. This pull request is to fix that bug.\r\n## List of Updates\r\n* Added in an argument called ***quiet***  to the nvm_rc_version() function at *line 339*\r\n* Printed anything inside the nvm_rc_version() only in the scenario where quiet mode is off\r\n* Ran the nvm_rc_version() function in quiet mode only if silent mode is on in the \"use\" command of nvm at *line 2990*\r\n* Ran *nvm_echo* and *nvm_err* inside the \"use\" command of nvm only in the scenario where silent mode is off (There were 4 scenarios where this was forgotten)\r\n* Created aliases for the --silent flag in ```nvm deactivate``` and ```nvm use```\r\n* Changed the unrequited local declaration of the NVM_NODE_PREFIX\r\n* Edited the ```nvm deactivate``` command to include a silent mode\r\n* Used silent mode inside the ```nvm use``` when running ```nvm deactivate``` inside it and silent mode is on\r\n* Updated the help page to include the --silent flag for ```nvm deactivate```\r\n## Tests\r\nA test is attached in the 'test/slow/nvm use' directory. It is named *Running \"nvm use node --silent\" doesn't print anything*. It runs ```nvm use node --silent and checks``` and succeeds if the OUTPUT matches the EXPECTED_OUTPUT which is *null*  or *''*. When the test was run locally, it still ouputed results if someone deleted some contents of the *.nvm/* folder. This output was given from the ```nvm deactivate command```. This was the reason that the ```nvm deactivate``` was edited to include silent mode.\r\n\r\n*Note: line numbers may be a bit off due to recent changes*\r\n\r\nFixes #2239",

Ran the wget install script\r\n\r\n- What happened? $NVM_DIR was set to nvm\r\n\r\n- What did you expect to happen? $NVM_DIR should be set to .nvm\r\nI added the following line from the README to my .zshrc:\r\n```\r\nexport NVM_DIR=\"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/.}nvm\"\r\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" # This loads nvm\r\n```\r\n\r\nI couldn't figure out why nvm wasn't loading, until I realized that \r\n`echo NVM_DIR=\"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/.}nvm\"` outputs `NVM_DIR=nvm`.\r\n\r\nChanging the line to `export NVM_DIR=\"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/}.nvm\"` fixed the problem. This outputs `NVM_DIR=.nvm` as expected. I tested this and the same behavior holds true in Bash as well.\r\n\r\n- Is there anything in any of your profile files (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc) that modifies the `PATH`? Nope\r\n\r\n<!-- if this does not apply, please delete this section -->\r\n- If you are having installation issues, or getting \"N/A\", what does `curl -I --compressed -v https://nodejs.org/dist/` print out?\r\n  <details>\r\n  <!-- do not delete the following blank line -->\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  </details>",

It also drops the ` >/dev/null 2>&1` part, because `rm -f` never prints any errors anyway.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I removed the line `unalias nvm_has_system_node` from `test/fast/Listing versions/teardown` because the tests don't create an alias (instead, they redefine the function `nvm_has_system_node`), and it looks like the new definition of `nvm_has_system_node` does not exist anymore after the tests have run (probably because the each test runs in its own process). But I only tested this on my machine by running the tests as scripts. For example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/.nvm/test/fast/'Listing versions'\r\n$ ./'Running \"nvm ls\" should include \"system\" when appropriate'\r\n$ type nvm_has_system_node\r\nnvm_has_system_node is a function\r\nnvm_has_system_node () \r\n{ \r\n    [ \"$(nvm deactivate >/dev/null 2>&1 && command -v node)\" != '' ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case I missed something and the behavior is different in other shells or in urchin, I'd be happy to add the `unalias` line again.",

The previous behaviour for other operating systems should stay untouched (more testing and feedback are welcome) (and maybe `aix` can also benefit from it, I don't know).\r\n\r\nThis PR does not handles the next issue, which is to compile certain versions of `Node.js` under OpenBSD. This issue, a bit more specific, is related to SSL libraries and requires more attention.\r\n\r\nI'm creating the pull request to ask you, if it makes sense to add this simple feature, even though the process is not entirely automated.\r\n\r\nDoes it?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notes**:\r\n- I did not add any tests because I wasn't sure what exactly should be tested in this case;\r\n- OpenBSD versions previous to 6.4 were not tested.\r\n\r\nFixes #2134",

It just isn't a strict enough check. One step would be to check for the presence of an executable `bin/node`, which is what this PR implements.\r\n\r\nEven more strict would be to actually try and invoke `bin/node` itself afterwards, and comparing `[ \"$(node -v)\" = \"v${1}\" ]`.

        "body": "I use [zsh-nvm](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm) ([lazy-loaded](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm#lazy-loading)) and [direnv](http://direnv.net/). I set up an `.envrc` that sources `nvm.sh` and then executes `nvm use` (`.nvmrc` file in the directory). This works fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as I actually then execute any nvm, npm, or globally installed node cli modules, the lazy loader kicks in and sources `nvm.sh`, which executes `nvm_auto`. When `nvm_auto` is executed, it doesn't take into account that nvm may have already loaded a specific version of node before that. (The reason it's not loaded yet even though it's been executed already by direnv is because direnv spawns a separate sub-shell to do its work.)\r\n\r\nThe first commit fixes that, by checking in `nvm_auto` whether the current nvm version is `system` or not.\r\n\r\nSomehow this is causing a lot of tests to fail in zsh (although in practice it works just fine in zsh). I can't for the life of me figure out why. Please comment on what I need to do to make them pass and I'll do it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in the case where nvm loads a version of node, and then the path is prepended to by another process, nvm should not mungle the path order when loading a new version of nvm.\r\n\r\nE.g. in my direnv example I prepend `\"$(npm bin)\"` to the path *after* loading `nvm.sh` and executing `nvm use`. This means that if there are locally installed as well as globally installed npm cli executables, the shell will prefer the locally installed versions. This makes sense, it's a nice way for projects not to have to worry whether the globally installed version is correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as nvm changes the path, either because `nvm use <version>` is executed, or in my case, the lazy loader kicks in and sources and loads nvm (this time with the correct version of node, thanks to the first commit), nvm strips the nvm-specific parts of the path, and then *prepends* the new versions of the nvm path to the path. This means that now, globally installed versions of node cli executables will be preferred by the shell. This is not good. It'd be better to respect a user's path ordering.\r\n\r\nThe second commit fixes that. `nvm_prepend_path` is removed. `nvm_change_path` is added. Test included. `nvm_change_path` prepends if there are no current nvm-specific parts of the path, otherwise it'll replace the nvm-specific part of the path, leaving the path order intact.",

In most cases this isn't a problem, but in the example I provided, as I was in the `/root` directory when I switched to user `bob`, the current directory is maintained which is `/root` and `bob` doesn't have read/write access there so when the NVM script is sourced it fails with permission errors. In theory, nothing sourced in the `.bashrc` should rely on the unkown current working directory and to fix NVM, all that's needed is to ensure the script runs in a location where it has access. As NVM is sourced by a users `.bashrc` I think it makes to sense that it runs in the users home directory, hence the change I'm proposing.\n",

This allows:\n- `io.js` installation from source\n- `node` v4+ installation from source\n- downloaded archives of binary and source downloads will now be cached and reused when checksums match\n- `nvm cache` commands to manage cached archives\n- tests now run with an updated gcc\n\n`installation_iojs` source tests are disabled, because they take too long in travis-ci to complete. I find this acceptable because the existing \"install from source\" code path is tested, and enough code is now shared that the risk is quite low.\n\nFixes #1188. Fixes #1193. Fixes #700. Obviates #1192. Unblocks #1053 & #779.\n",

This happened because `git describe` describes a\ncommit using the most recent tag reachable from it. Since I already had\na tag checked out, it was describing the tag I had already checked out.\n\nThankfully, `git describe` accepts an optional commit-ish, which it will\nuse instead of what we have currently checked out. Testing this in my\nterminal now gives me the latest tag on origin, which is what I am\ninterested in when updating to the latest version.\n\n```\n  ~/.nvm \u276f\u276f\u276f git describe --abbrev=0 --tags\n  v0.30.1\n  ~/.nvm \u276f\u276f\u276f git describe --abbrev=0 --tags origin\n  v0.31.3\n```\n\nI also added it to the manual install instructions for consistency and\nextra safety.\n\n---\n\nEnsure `git describe` only matches version tags\n\n`git describe` will match the latest tags, regardless of what it looks\nlike. We can make this a little safer by adding a `--match` flag to\nmatch tags that look like version tags. This allows the maintainers of\nthis repo to more safely add other types of tags if they so wish,\nwithout causing people to install or upgrade to those versions.\n\n---\n\nUse subshells for installation and upgrade instructions\n\nI recently upgraded my copy of nvm and I was disappointed to be dropped\nin the .nvm directory at the end of it. I also didn't like having to\ncopy and paste two separate blocks of code into my terminal, because I\nmissed the second one the first time around and was left in a slightly\nconfusing state. So, I decided to make this easier by utilizing\nsubshells and moving all of the instructions into one code block in this\ndocument. I think this will improve people's experience maintaining this\ntool.\n",

        "body": "Hello,\n\nreferring to https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/860, a possibility to reduce nvm-sourcing time by sending the `npm config get prefix` command to a background task. For me, it reduces the time by more than a half.\n\nThere is one inconvenience when deleting a previously set prefix via `nvm use --delete-prefix v6.0.0`, I think related to https://github.com/creationix/nvm/pull/1006, the cursor is set to an awkward position, but e.g. pressing Ctrl-C brings it to a normal position.\n\nI manually tested `sh`,`bash`,`zsh` and `ksh` in interactive mode. `ksh` is not working for me, it doesn't know the `local` keyword (thus unrelated). There are no tests yet as I don't know whether backgrounding is an acceptable solution. It could be enabled for interactive mode and disabled for non-interactive mode maybe. As it is a warning for non-spec-compliant use, an asynchronous warning may be sufficient.\n\nI had to redirect npm's &2 to &1 so that it didn't cause the cursor to move to awkward position on every sourcing.\n\nBest regards, Adam\n",

        "body": "This branch adds support for https://github.com/iojs/io.js / https://iojs.org/\n\nThe following features should now work:\n- `nvm install iojs` will install the latest `io.js` version. `nvm ls iojs` and `nvm use iojs` will function as you'd expect.\n- `nvm install node` will install the latest stable `node` version. `nvm ls node` and `nvm use node` will function as you'd expect.\n- In general, a specific `io.js` version can be referenced with the \"iojs-\" prefix. If `node` were to ever release a `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.0` would refer to `node`, and `iojs-v1.0.0` would refer to `io.js`. In the near future, `node-v1.0.0` will also refer to `node` unambiguously. This applies to all `nvm` commands, including working with aliases and `.nvmrc` files.\n- `io.js`, unlike `node`, does not have a SunOS binary. Please open an issue on https://github.com/iojs/io.js if this is actually a problem for anyone, as currently it seems like this won't be for anybody.\n\n**Note**: checksum support upon installation is currently disabled. Relates to https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/368.\n**Note**: installation of `io.js` directly from source (via the `-s` option) is not yet enabled. This will be added soon.\n\nRelates to https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/40 https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/420\nFixes #590\n\nI'm going to merge and release this after a number of people test this on their own machines - hopefully sometime on the 19th.\n\nConstructive feedback about this feature, or its usage, is welcome. Please keep \"+1\"'s and comments that add no value to a minimum.\n",

If this is rejected I won't bother, but if you are interested in merging, but want backwards compatibility, then I have another idea of using symlinks in addition to files.\n\nOne thing to note is why I am removing the link if it exists before creating it instead of just using `ln -f`. This is because (on OS X at least) if you `ln -sf path/to/dir existing/link/to/old/dir` then it creates a link inside of `existing/link/to/old/dir`. This essentially gives you `existing/link/to/old/dir/dir`, which points to nothing if `path/to/dir` is relative.\n\n---\n\nThis is my first contribution to nvm so wanted to note a few of issues I came across. These are not related to this pull request:\n- `nvm deactivate` fails in OS X Mavericks, and fails test of course (might be if PATH is set by launchd).\n- Not sure what is the preferred shell compatibility nvm is going for. It looks to be bash, but there's many inconsistencies between using bash only things versus sh compatible things.\n- There are quite a few variables not declared as local (ALIAS being one of them).\n\nIf you are interested in further pull requests for these, please let me know.\n",

It is a non-obtrusive fix. The patch in #223 uses `eval`, which can be dangerous.

If not it will return 'N/A' and therefore no globally installed node version gets recognized as long as there is no locally installed node version within this current NVM_DIR. \nAfter this Pull Request you could ship nvm preinstalled with your node application and use it to install/update node also locally into your application. This could be useful during development for other devs.\n\nTo make the standalone `nvm` usable from outside i also added a `which`, `root` and `bin` command.\n- which returns the absolute path to the currently used node version. For example: \n\n```\n$ ./nvm which\n/Users/thomas/Projects/nvm/v0.9.0/bin/node\n```\n- root prints the absolute path to the root of the currently used node version - the path where the bin and lib dir is.

        "body": "I've used nvm easily with most of my existing systems, but a newly installed mint system did not have curl installed by default.\n\nnvm did not function, and provided the error \"need curl to proceed\", I installed curl, and nvm refused to function - even curl provided the same error, which was rather odd.  Eventually i realized that nvm creates a curl function in the \"global\" shell environment, and when sourced from .bashrc it overwrites the existing (if it exists) curl function, preventing a subsequently installed curl from functioning until the bash shell is restarted\n\nThis behaviour could be very confusing to those not familiar with bash / sourcing behavior.  (like myself :P)\n\nand since curl is only required for those downloading tarballs, I moved it into the install branch of the nvm function.\n\nIf this is not an adequate solution, then let me know and we can brainstorm on it a bit.\n",

        "body": "As of the recent v0.6.10 release of node, it has become apparent that nvm_version is not correctly handling the version sorting.\n\nThere are really two bug fixes here, both to the way nvm uses the 'sort' command.\n\nFirst, the argument \"2,1n\" is illegal, and was being ignored, because position 2 is after 1, and it causes sort to incorrectly interpret the later keys like \"2,2n\" and \"3,3n\" as well.  That's why v0.6.10 is exercising the problem.\n\nHowever, even if we changed it to \"1,1n\", it still wouldn't quite work for \"v1.0.0\".\n\nThat's because \"-t.\" tells sort to break up v0.6.10 into \"v0\" \"6\", \"10\", and unfortunately \"v0\" is not numeric at all, so it would not correctly sort \"v0\" before \"v1\".\n\nSo, by removing the \"n\" from the first specifier, it just sorts the first part using ASCII, which will work up until node hits \"v10.0.0\".  I can live with that.  :)\n\nFWIW, I think skipping over the \"v\" may have been why the \"2,1n\" slipped in there in the first place, but it clearly didn't work.\n",

        "body": "In my .profile, I often setup an alias for ls to use:\nalias ls='ls -F'\n\nThis gives me nicer readability from this common command in my shell.\n\nnvm.sh, however, is using ls without a backslash, which causes it to use the aliased version, rather than the default system version of ls.  It causes the automatic version selection logic to think there are slashes in the name.\n\nI just added backslashes to all uses of ls in nvm.sh, which is a common practice to force the unaliased version of a command in shell scripts.  If no alias exists, it has no effect, so it's a harmless addition.\n\nHope you agree this is the intended use of ls, and a useful addition to keep nvm.sh less brittle to the environment.\n",

        "body": "I just switched from nave to nvm, and it makes me smile. But I was missing the ability nave has to show you what versions are available, and labels like \"latest\" and \"stable\". So I hacked up a few enhancements to version descriptions:\n1. Logic to calculate things like \"current\", \"latest\", \"stable\", and show them in `nvm ls`\n2. Support for more flexible version names - instead of `nvm use v0.3.6` you could do `nvm use latest` or `nvm use 0.3`, for example.\n3. Cache of the versions available from nodejs.org/dist (using `nvm sync`), stored as plain text files in the `.nvm` directory\n\nIt was important to me that nvm not _depend_ on an `nvm sync`. So you can use it _exactly_ as before, and `nvm ls` will only show installed versions. You can explicitly define a version number for `nvm install`, and it will do just that. I tried it with an implicit `nvm sync` if you ls and there are no versions at all, but that seemed a bit too heavy-handed for my first commit to the project. ;-)\n\nIn addition, the way this is written should open up the way for user-defined aliases (think `nvm alias projectX v0.3.6`, for tracking, for instance, a version that you deploy a certain project with so you can easily test against the same version), and in turn binding a default version on start-up, perhaps with `nvm alias default <version>`).\n\nAlways open to suggestions for improvements, too!\n",
