Here are the pros of using such an alias:\r\n\r\n1. **Simplified Access**: The alias simplifies the process of accessing the shell of a specific Docker container. Instead of typing the full `docker exec` command with the container ID or name, you can use a concise and memorable alias (`dsh`) followed by the container name.\r\n\r\n2. **Increased Productivity**: The alias saves time and keystrokes, which can enhance productivity, especially when you need to access Docker containers frequently. It streamlines the workflow for developers and system administrators.\r\n\r\n3. **Ease of Use**: For users who are not familiar with the intricacies of Docker commands, having an easy-to-use alias abstracts away the complexity. This makes it more accessible to team members who might not be Docker experts.\r\n\r\n4. **Consistency**: By using a standardized alias across team members and projects, you establish consistency in your workflow. Everyone can use the same alias, ensuring that the process of accessing Docker containers remains uniform.\r\n\r\n5. **Reduced Typographical Errors**: The alias reduces the chance of typographical errors when executing `docker exec` commands manually. This is especially helpful when dealing with long container IDs or complex container names.\r\n\r\n6. **Scripting and Automation**: If you have scripts that need to interact with Docker containers, using an alias in your scripts simplifies the code and makes it more readable. This can lead to cleaner, more maintainable automation scripts.\r\n\r\n7. **Learning and Teaching**: For educational purposes, having a simplified alias can aid in teaching Docker concepts. It allows learners to focus on the core ideas without getting bogged down by the specific syntax of Docker commands.\r\n\r\n8. **Customization**: The alias can be easily modified or extended to include additional functionality, such as running specific commands within the container context. This flexibility allows users to tailor the alias to their specific needs.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the `dsh()` alias provides a more user-friendly and efficient way to interact with Docker containers, offering simplicity, consistency, and productivity benefits for both individual developers and teams working with Dockerized applications.\r\n",

It\u2019s unlikely *many* users will be doing genome analyses, but perhaps the existence in a major package manager is enough reason to avoid the alias?\r\n\r\n2. `gta` for `git tag --annotate` (suggested in #10854).\r\n\r\n   This makes an \u201cannotated tag\u201d, the modern tag format that includes a message, the author details, and timestamp. Annotated tags should nearly always be used, so we can help this with an alias.\r\n\r\n   It\u2019s also a bit weird we already have `gts` for `git tag --sign`, which is an extended form of annotated tag with GPG-signing. I would think GPG-signing is much less common than unsigned tags.\r\n  \r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nCloses #10747 \r\nCloses #10854 \r\n",

(Representation can be added by setting up a textconv filter.)\r\n\r\nSecond, with `--text`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git stash show --text\r\ndiff --git donut.png donut.png\r\nnew file mode 100644\r\nindex 0000000..be8dd81\r\n--- /dev/null\r\n+++ donut.png\r\n@@ -0,0 +1,938 @@\r\n+<89>PNG^M\r\n+^Z\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output continues with the remainder of the PNG's bytes. This is never useful behaviour since even if you could read the binary data, it isn't well displayed. On some terminal setups, random bytes can break rendering.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nThe `--text` option was included with the creation of the alias, way back in #1864, without any discussion.\r\n",

Like `--hard`, it moves the current branch to point to a named commit, but it does not throw away uncommitted changes. I would say this is generally a better idea as uncommitted changes are precious\u2014Git provides no way to retrieve them, since Git tracks files *within* commits.\r\n\r\n`--keep` is not well known, perhaps due to the obtuse description [in the docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#Documentation/git-reset.txt---keep). I\u2019m trying to change that and promote it.\r\n\r\n### 2. `grhs` = `git reset --soft`\r\n\r\n`--soft` undoes commits, and preserves their changes. It\u2019s similar to the default mode, `--mixed`, but keeps the changes staged:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git reset --soft @~\r\n\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch commentary\r\nChanges to be committed:\r\n    modified:   hamlet.txt\r\n    modified:   macbeth.txt\r\n\r\nChanges not staged for commit:\r\n    modified:   othello.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means you can tweak the changes before committing them again. With the default mode, you have to re-add changes before making another commit.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nCloses #9398 \r\n",

This avoids lines being wide except where needed. It also makes it easier to edit the table without introducing broken alignment, like I did before as fixed in #11878.\r\n3. Fix the display of some aliases. For example, `gbgd` and `gbgD` weren't showing the whole aliased command due to unescaped `|` characters (interpreted by Markdown as a column marker).\r\n4. Improve some wording.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nThis will cause merge conflicts with open PRs, but they will be fairly easy to fix, editing the table contents to meet the new style.\r\n\r\nI tested the change by scanning through each table row, checking it was rendering correctly.\r\n",

When no commit range is specified, that means the initial commit.\r\n\r\nFor example, in one of my projects, I created the `.editorconfig` file in the initial commit. A vanilla `git blame` on that file shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git blame .editorconfig\r\n^d7a14a1 (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  1) # http://editorconfig.org\r\n^d7a14a1 (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  2)\r\n^d7a14a1 (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  3) root = true\r\n^d7a14a1 (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  4)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`d7a14a1` is the abbreviated SHA for the initial commit in the project, and the `^` prefix indicates it as the boundary commit.\r\n\r\nAdding `-b` changes the output to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git blame -b .editorconfig | cat\r\n         (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  1) # http://editorconfig.org\r\n         (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  2)\r\n         (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  3) root = true\r\n         (Adam Johnson 2022-12-08 13:41:33 +0000  4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe commit SHA is gone for all lines untouched since the initial commit, although the author name and date remain.\r\n\r\nIMO, this is confusing to those who haven\u2019t got deep knowledge of `git blame`.\r\n\r\noh-my-zsh added `-b` with the `gbl` alias in #2790, copied out of #2433, without discussion of the options. I propose removing it. Advanced Git users can enable the behaviour globally if they like with the [`blame.blankBoundary` option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt-blameblankBoundary):\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit config --global blame.blankBoundary true\r\n```",

I'm happy to split out into separate prs or remove any of these aliases if considered too niche.\r\n\r\n`gusup` is a weird one, so please suggest if you think there's a more intuitive alias for that command!",

Example: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The PR title is descriptive.\r\n- [x] The PR doesn't replicate another PR that is already open.\r\n- [x] I have read the contribution guide and followed all the instructions.\r\n- [x] The code follows the code style guide detailed in the wiki.\r\n- [x] The code is mine or it's from somewhere with an MIT-compatible license.\r\n- [x] The code is efficient, to the best of my ability, and does not waste computer resources.\r\n- [x] The code is stable and I have tested it myself, to the best of my abilities.\r\n- [x] If the code introduces new aliases, I provide a valid use case for all plugin users down below.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n\r\n> Before starting, I want to clarify the norms I will use.\r\n> On `alias a=abc`, 'abc' is the source of the alias, and 'a' is the destination of the alias.\r\n> If this naming seems inappropriate, please let me know. I couldn't find better names... \r\n> (This is important because the same namings are also written in [readme](https://github.com/roeniss/ohmyzsh/commit/6eb647d5a5b9f8dad3c5ab5b8d8060c65af546a5#diff-7a6e14abfc821561312a2d3217f3d66c89bb4237460daa7fb0c03ceaaffe84a6R17)) \r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. --cheaper/-c\r\n\r\n- Add `--cheaper/-c` option: Shows only the aliases where the destination is shorter than the current input (command). This option could filter out the following example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n> alias g=git\r\n> alias longerCmd=git\r\n> alias-finder -c git\r\ng=git\r\n# longerCmd would be filtered out\r\n>\r\n```\r\n- You might wonder how such an odd alias could exist: When I made an issue I had a very specific plausible case but now I forgot. I'm sorry about such a poor example above.\r\n- At the beginning, I tried with `shorter`, but it doesn't make sense with names on existing options (longer, exact) because those are about the source of aliases, and my new option is about the destination of aliases. You can see a more detailed explanation (not much different) on [readme](https://github.com/roeniss/ohmyzsh/commit/6eb647d5a5b9f8dad3c5ab5b8d8060c65af546a5#diff-7a6e14abfc821561312a2d3217f3d66c89bb4237460daa7fb0c03ceaaffe84a6R19-R21)\r\n\r\n### 2. Reformat codes\r\n\r\nThe original codebase was pretty efficient but hard to follow (maybe because of my lack of competency). So I add some comments, refactor the codebase, and flatten the flow.\r\n\r\n### 3. Support zstyle\r\n\r\nAs suggested in [the original issue](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/11624#issuecomment-1517966744), I added some zstyle options but still support previous env variable option for backward compatibility (also added TODO comments for them). Because the env variable is not preferable, I removed the relevant section from readme. \r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nI tried `zunit` test framework and it was quite helpful. But none of the plugins seems not having testcode like that Should I remove it from this pr?\r\n\r\nOne last thing: I haven't made pr for a change like this for any open source before. So if I was wrong somewhere, please give me some advice on that. :D",

Solution based on: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/2041#issuecomment-990253001\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\nWhen you add the Pyenv plugin to the `~/.zshrc` file and restart the terminal, you can get a message about pyenv being badlye configured. Even after following all the suggested advice, it can often still appear. This is due to the installation instructions being unclear, and often simply appending the needed commands to the end of the `~/.zshrc` file. However, this can be cleared up by running the necessary commands AFTER the plugin is initialized.\r\n\r\nThere is no mention of this requirement anywhere outside of that one comment thread, and adding a simple suggestion would go a long way to helping new installs. I would prefer that the requirement for it being before the plugins are initialized not be a requirement, but I would not know how to make that fix.\r\n",

If the terminal doesn't support this, it isn't feasible to add links as they'd be fully visible in the terminal output.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I suspect you'll have an opinion about the suitability of this PR. I'll be happy to amend it as required, especially if you have anything else you'd like in that conditional statement.\r\n\r\nFixes #11545",

        "body": "## Standards checklist:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill with an x the ones that apply. Example: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The PR title is descriptive.\r\n- [x] The PR doesn't replicate another PR which is already open.\r\n- [x] I have read the contribution guide and followed all the instructions.\r\n- [x] The code follows the code style guide detailed in the wiki.\r\n- [x] The code is mine or it's from somewhere with an MIT-compatible license.\r\n- [x] The code is efficient, to the best of my ability, and does not waste computer resources.\r\n- [x] The code is stable and I have tested it myself, to the best of my abilities.\r\n- [x] If the code introduces new aliases, I provide a valid use case for all plugin users down below.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n\r\n- The itertools.groupby function operates by grouping together *contiguous* items that have the same key. Since the `exps` list is unordered with respect to the 3rd element (i.e., they key for the group), this results in chunking together of items with the same key only if it is fortunate enough to be immediately before or immediately after another expression with the same key. Without sorting the list of `exps`, numerous expressions get put into a bin of one when they should be included in a larger group, which results in erroneously putting these expressions into the \"_default\" group.\r\n- Aliases that previously showed up in the \"_default\" group when invoking `acs`, even though other aliases existed with the same base command, are now categorized correctly. The \"_default\" group now only shows aliases that truly do not share a base command with other aliases.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nAs an example, enable the `web_search` plugin and notice that before this change, the command `acs web_search` results in the following:\r\n```\r\n[_default]\r\n\tbing = web_search bing\r\n\tbrs = web_search brave\r\n\tddg = web_search duckduckgo\r\n\tducky = web_search duckduckgo \\!\r\n\tecosia = web_search ecosia\r\n\timage = web_search duckduckgo \\!i\r\n\tmap = web_search duckduckgo \\!m\r\n\tnews = web_search duckduckgo \\!n\r\n\tqwant = web_search qwant\r\n\tscholar = web_search scholar\r\n\r\n[web_search]\r\n\tarchive = web_search archive\r\n\task = web_search ask\r\n\tbaidu = web_search baidu\r\n\tgithub = web_search github\r\n\tgivero = web_search givero\r\n\tgoodreads = web_search goodreads\r\n\tgoogle = web_search google\r\n\tsp = web_search startpage\r\n\tstackoverflow = web_search stackoverflow\r\n\twiki = web_search duckduckgo \\!w\r\n\twolframalpha = web_search wolframalpha\r\n\tyahoo = web_search yahoo\r\n\tyandex = web_search yandex\r\n\tyoutube = web_search duckduckgo \\!yt\r\n```\r\nAnd after the change in this commit, `acs web_search` yields the correct result:\r\n```\r\n[web_search]\r\n\tarchive = web_search archive\r\n\task = web_search ask\r\n\tbaidu = web_search baidu\r\n\tbing = web_search bing\r\n\tbrs = web_search brave\r\n\tddg = web_search duckduckgo\r\n\tducky = web_search duckduckgo \\!\r\n\tecosia = web_search ecosia\r\n\tgithub = web_search github\r\n\tgivero = web_search givero\r\n\tgoodreads = web_search goodreads\r\n\tgoogle = web_search google\r\n\timage = web_search duckduckgo \\!i\r\n\tmap = web_search duckduckgo \\!m\r\n\tnews = web_search duckduckgo \\!n\r\n\tqwant = web_search qwant\r\n\tscholar = web_search scholar\r\n\tsp = web_search startpage\r\n\tstackoverflow = web_search stackoverflow\r\n\twiki = web_search duckduckgo \\!w\r\n\twolframalpha = web_search wolframalpha\r\n\tyahoo = web_search yahoo\r\n\tyandex = web_search yandex\r\n\tyoutube = web_search duckduckgo \\!yt\r\n```\r\n",

Use `pacman` rather than `expac` in `paclist`\r\nThe **`expac`** command is a community repository, **usually not installed** by users.\r\n*Using only  `pacman`, the output information is more useful and more acceptable to native users.*\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\nThis PR is rebuilt from #10919 .\r\n",

Notable expceptions to this are:\r\n\r\n- All standard reports receive a set of three additional aliases to easily filter tasks that are due in the day, week and month.\r\n- Since Taskwarrior version 2.6, the user has the option to \"purge\" tasks instead of deleting them. This allows users to completely wipe out unwanted data from their program. However, in order to purge a task, one must get its UUID. I have made an alias to easily use the UUIDs of _all_ deleted tasks as the input to the command.\r\n\r\nDuplicate aliases that conflict with other plugins are highlighted with comments, please instruct wether they should be renamed or not.\r\n\r\nI do not know why the other PR was closed, the thread ended without a clear explanation. Should this implementation not be of the developers' interest, please let me know.",

Example: [This very simple PR from 2 months ago](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/pull/10998)\r\n2. there seems to be some inconsistencies in code merged that a maintainer could keep an eye on and remind contributors of in their PRs. Example: [This commit that updated the aliases, but didn't update the corresponding docs](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/commit/3f50482674c2b3153590a4aba92fbfa1c01bc583)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if just adding myself is \"the process\" or not, but please let me know if this requires some additional steps.",

This may seem like a sensible choice, as `yay` is the most popular AUR helper. However, because of this, it is installed by default on a lot more distributions of arch, and included by default in more install helpers. This means that if the user chooses to install one of the less popular options, it will be overwritten by `yay`'s alias. \r\n\r\nI have ordered the alias creation in order of popularity (from their page in the AUR), so that the least popular package manager will have priority for the `upgrade` alias. This may seem counterintuitive, but if something is less popular, it is more likely to have been installed intentionally by the user, as opposed to being included by default. This is why I believe the least popular option should, if installed, have priority for the `upgrade` alias.",

If the user does not have a value for LS_COLORS then if the value can be determined from the system by using dircolors then use that one, if not then use the default LS_COLORS unless it is not overwritten by a theme\r\n\r\nNot having a default LS_COLORS value on MacOS results in the following situation:\r\n- ls will take the values from LSCOLORS which have a default color, or are overwritten by theams\r\n- zsh tab completion will have no colors set because on mac there is no default value for LS_COLORS\r\nthis results in the mismatch of colors between ls and zsh tab completion\r\n\r\n- move the setup for zsh tab completion from lib/theme-and-appearance.zsh to the end of oh-my-zsh.sh\r\nwhile ls evaluates the LS_COLORS value every time it is called, it seems that zsh tab completion does not.\r\nin this case we need to set zsh tab completion only after the theme is sourced in order to have the correct colors.\r\n\r\nTesting was done on wsl and macos:\r\nWsl(theme: arrow)\r\nno fix: ![wls_no_fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3298487/183012465-992efbbd-40bd-4195-a101-0187af345ead.png)\r\nwith fix: ![wls_with_fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3298487/183012519-ab1fffc2-4cb3-4cad-b970-d9584ae52532.png)\r\n\r\nMacOS(theme: arrow)\r\nno fix: <img width=\"795\" alt=\"macos_no_fix\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3298487/183012550-c181b703-2fc8-458c-98eb-9e5bcae7b1f8.png\">\r\nwith fix: <img width=\"795\" alt=\"macos_with_fix\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3298487/183012555-f05fe99f-bdfb-4ddf-b753-f02358b2639b.png\">\r\n\r\nMacOS(theme: robbyrussell)\r\nno fix: <img width=\"795\" alt=\"macos_no_fix_default\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3298487/183012552-8738a087-0336-4db5-85df-68c763d8135c.png\">\r\nwith fix: <img width=\"795\" alt=\"macos_with_fix_default\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3298487/183012556-82971189-2fcf-4829-9788-46d0bf924428.png\">\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nThis proposal is related to the following:\r\n- https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/pull/6353\r\n- https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/6060",

Optimize the implementation of `pacdisowned`\r\n- Use `mktemp` to create the temporary directory.\r\nIn the Archlinux environment, **`mktemp` is part of the base installation**, so there is no need to worry about its existence.\r\n\r\n- Remove search path `/bin`, `/sbin` and `/lib`\r\nIn the Archlinux environment, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib` and `/lib64` (which even not mentioned in the current version) are just **soft links** to the folders under /usr.\r\n```bash\r\n$ ls -ld /bin /sbin /lib /lib64\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Dec  7 10:41 /bin -> usr/bin\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Dec  7 10:41 /lib -> usr/lib\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Dec  7 10:41 /lib64 -> usr/lib\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Dec  7 10:41 /sbin -> usr/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The command string passed to the `trap` command should use **double quotes** to ensure that parameter expansion inside is done immediately (`tmp_dir` is declared as `local`).\r\n\r\n- Temporary files should be cleaned up **as soon as possible** after use, instead of waiting for the `trap` to take effect.\r\n\r\n### 2. Use `pacman` rather than `expac` in `paclist`\r\nThe **`expac`** command is a community repository, **usually not installed** by users.\r\n*Using only  `pacman`, the output information is more useful and more acceptable to native users.*\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\nNone\r\n",

If git don't have your gpg key you can't use gts (git tag -s) to sign\r\n- `gtn` alias for git tag -n, why? To see all tags with their messages, the `-n` flag expect a number for number of lines (default=1). Actually `gtn` is a function\r\n\r\nWorkflow:\r\n- `gta v1.69.420 -m \"This if a message for this tag.\\nIt can be\\na multi-line\\nmessage\"`\r\n- `gtn` -> view all tags with their messages showing only the first line of each message\r\n- `gtn 3` -> view all tags with their messages showing up to 3 lines for each message\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nAs I said, `gtn` is a function, is under the other `git tag` aliases and not in the functions section.\r\nIn the README file there are a lot of functions marked as aliases, it is planned to move these functions to the functions table?\r\n",

Millions of people are being forced to flee their homes and leave everything behind.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there seems to be no easy way to deescalate such horrendous conflict.\r\n\r\nFor decades the development community has been showing the world that is possible to work together, independent of race of nationality. And this project one such example.\r\n\r\nThis change is not a political statement. It's not about good or bad, right or wrong. It's simply about the unnecessary suffering that millions of people are being subject to.\r\n\r\nI noticed some other projects are taking similar actions. I think we should join the movement and hopefully the world can see that we do not stand by this (nor by any other) war.\r\n\r\n## Standards checklist:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill with an x the ones that apply.

If the file is there, the `fpath` will be filled with `$plugin_dir/<contents of completions-dir.txt>` instead of `$plugin_dir`.\r\n\r\nThis should not cause any breaking change, as no custom plugins would already have such a file.\r\n\r\nIt will be taken into account for custom plugins. This will decrease the amount of times we check for the file, and I think it's very reasonable that the plugins in this repo (not custom ones) needs to follow the rule of having completions in their root directories.\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding my concern at duplications in `fpath` (https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/10412#issuecomment-967214321), there isn't much we can do about it in Oh My ZSH itself. My suggestion is that this should be handled in the plugins, like how I did in https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/pull/835.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/10412\r\n\r\nThe PR which implements this at zsh-completions is https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/pull/835.\r\n\r\nI'm testing this at https://github.com/felipecrs/dotfiles/pull/59.",

        "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nWhile setting up [zpm](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/zpm), I discovered that some oh-my-zsh plugins don't work correctly with it. In my case, `macos` and `z`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(anon):source:261: no such file or directory: /home/curtis/code/ctrueden/dotfiles/music\r\n(anon):source:264: no such file or directory: /home/curtis/code/ctrueden/dotfiles/spotify\r\n(anon):source:2: no such file or directory: ./z.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Diagnosis\r\n\r\nThe problem is caused by the usage of the `$0` environment variable. The author of zpm, @grigorii-horos, writes in zpm-zsh/zpm#39 that a declaration `0=${(%):-%N}` needs to be present for expressions involving `$0`, but the affected plugins do not have such a declaration. There is also another issue zpm-zsh/zpm#36 specifically discussing this issue with respect to the `macos` plugin.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nIn the case of `zpm`, you can work around the problem by adding a `,source:my.plugin.zsh` suffix to the `zpm load` command. For example, for `z`, change:\r\n```zsh\r\nzpm load @omz/z\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\nzpm load @omz/z,source:z.plugin.zsh\r\n```\r\nBut if I understand correctly, this makes `zpm` re-source the plugin every time, rather than caching it for performance?\r\n\r\nEdit: I have now tested on both macOS and Linux, and the above workaround only works on my Linux system, not my macOS system. So YMMV. But the solution implemented in this PR addresses the problem on both platforms.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nI decided I would try my hand at a PR for the `macos` plugin. But while grep for `${0...}` usages within ohmyzsh codebase, I discovered quite a few. So this PR then became an attempt to fix all the instances of this issue that I found. I am a long-time *nix shell user, but not a zsh expert, so please consider it an attempt to start a dialogue about this issue, so that we can have better behavior between oh-my-zsh, zpm, and potentially other plugin managers as well.\r\n\r\n## Points to consider\r\n\r\n* As part of this work, I wanted to put a comment next to every `0=` declaration pointing to the Zsh Plugin Standard document, which is apparently where this whole thing got started. Unfortunately, the commonly shared URL for that standard, `http://zdharma.org/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html`, is now defunct. (One plugin in this repository, `zsh-navigation-tools`, [references that broken link](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/904f8685f75ff5dd3f544f8c6f2cabb8e5952e9a/plugins/zsh-navigation-tools/zsh-navigation-tools.plugin.zsh#L10-L11), so I updated it as part of this PR.) I found a newer functional URL for the standard at https://z-shell.github.io/zsh-plugin-assessor/Zsh-Plugin-Standard, although it appears that the `zsh-plugin-assessor` repository was recently renamed from `Zsh-100-Commits-Club`, so another URL `http://z-shell.github.io/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard` is also floating around and unfortunately does not redirect to the current location.\r\n\r\n* The Zsh Plugin Standard's recommended `$0` block is more complex than the one given by @grigorii-horos; I opted for the one given in the standard. If people think the more concise expression `0=${(%):-%N}` is better/sufficient, I can update the PR to use that expression instead\u2014just let me know.\r\n\r\n* I tried to put the `$0` handling code near where the `$0` gets referenced in each plugin, and nested inside the corresponding `if` statement where applicable. If people think it would be better to have these declarations always at the top of each file, I can update the PR to do that instead\u2014just let me know.\r\n\r\n* I don't like that the same 2-4 lines of code are repeated in many places across the codebase. I'm hopeful that the oh-my-zsh experts here can suggest a [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)er way of organizing this\u2014perhaps some common function that can be used as a one-liner where needed? But regardless, I think this PR is a step forward compared to the currently broken behavior of various plugins.\r\n\r\n* I confess that I did not test this change for every affected plugin, since I don't use them all. However, I did update my zpm installation to use this PR's branch, and the errors cited above go away, and everything appears to work correctly. If more thorough testing is needed, please just let me know what is needed and I will try to do it.\r\n\r\nFinally, apologies if this topic has already been covered in a previous issue or PR. I tried searching for it, but could not find anything\u2014as you can imagine, expressions like `0=${(%):-%N}` do not exactly make search engines happy. \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\n## Standards checklist:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill with an x the ones that apply.

        "body": "It's great that oh-my-zsh supports a \"reminder\" mode for updating.  I personally prefer the (default) prompting behavior.  However, I occasionally inadvertently dismiss it (usually as part of a \"new tab -> start typing first command\" workflow).  When I do so, I usually want to do the update as soon as possible afterwards.  I have a terrible memory, so it's a nice QOL change to emit the command to manually update, so that I can know what to run right away to trigger the update (rather than waiting for the next time I open a new shell).  This is kind of the best of both worlds of the prompt + reminder behavior.\r\n\r\n## Standards checklist:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill with an x the ones that apply.

I tracked the `title:4` error to this `-n \"$INSIDE_EMACS\"` condition and have changed it to `-n \"${INSIDE_EMACS:-}\"`. The problem appears to have been introduced in a263cdac9:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/lib/termsupport.zsh b/lib/termsupport.zsh\r\nindex ef0d7889..49f64400 100644\r\n--- a/lib/termsupport.zsh\r\n+++ b/lib/termsupport.zsh\r\n@@ -7,8 +7,7 @@\r\n # (In screen, only short_tab_title is used)\r\n # Limited support for Apple Terminal (Terminal can't set window and tab separately)\r\n function title {\r\n-  emulate -L zsh\r\n-  setopt prompt_subst\r\n+  setopt localoptions nopromptsubst\r\n \r\n   # Don't set the title if inside emacs, unless using vterm\r\n   [[ -n \"$INSIDE_EMACS\" && \"$INSIDE_EMACS\" != vterm ]] && return\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I revert the title function to what it was previously, I no longer get the error.

It is shipped for example with Fedora Silverblue. Since toolbox should be used for isolated developer enviroments similiar to virtualenv but with containers, I wrote this plugin to ease the use of toolbox.\r\n\r\nThe plugin acts in similar fashin to the virtualenvwrapper plugin. If a git directory is found it will enter the default toolbox, or it will read a container name from a `.toolbox` file. If the git directory is exited, the toolbox is also exited. This behavior can be customized with env variables.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some convenient aliases are set.\r\n\r\nAll of this is also documented in the README.",

I\u2019ve also linked to the relevant page on the Homebrew site.",

Obviously this gets annoying really quickly as each new foreground app has to be approved separately. Getting the pid of the frontmost app only requires this permission to be granted once, for the \"System Events\" app.\r\n",

Now I'm back to where I was before - without having to delete an unused local branch.\r\n\r\nthere may be reason to make this `gswdt` to prevent confusion with other aliases that reference the `develop` branch.\r\n\r\n### Usage note for remote branches\r\nUsing this with a remote branch without specifying the name of the remote (e.g., origin) will result in the following fatal error for most configurations:\r\n\r\n`fatal: '--detach' cannot be used with '-b/-B/--orphan'`\r\n\r\nThis is because the standard git configuration includes `checkout.guess=true`, so git attempts to create a new branch\r\n when the identifier exists on origin but not locally. Confusingly, it references the `-b/-B` options from `git checkout`, rather than the `-c` option from `git switch`.\r\n\r\n`git switch -d --no-guess my-remote-branch` gives a less confusing error in this scenario: `fatal: invalid reference: my-remote-branch`, but I wasn't sure if it made sense to include this flag in the alias. Logically, `git switch --detach` should only be usable with `--no-guess`.",

It also closes #9165 issue.\r\nIt would be great to have some feedback about the completion function, for me is working but it's the first time that I tried something like this.

For a series of consecutive query commands, a user has to wait for the pointless 'repository refresh' every time. This patch asks `zypper` to not refresh repositories. If a user intends to do that, they would need to use `sudo` anyway, which the `zref` alias already does.\r\n",

This function relies on 'terraform workspace show' which could be very slow operation.   To speed up I made the following changes\r\n\r\n- Check for .terraform/environment directory.  If it doesn't exist we are probably not in the terraform stack or the stack doesn't have custom workspace\r\n- To get the workspace one just needs to look into .terraform/environment file.  It contains the workspace name.  No need to launch the terraform command because it is very slow\r\n- Also, added tf_prompt_info to the list of prompt_info functions in lib/prompt_info.  So that theme writers are aware of it\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Borrowing further from fish concepts, it also adds funcsave and funced functions, and is well documented with a README that contains a detailed description of the functionality. Similar to how the globalias plugin brings abbr functionality from fish to zsh, the zfunctions plugin would give a really solid and performant lazy function loader feature to oh-my-zsh.\r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\n\r\nNot sure how, but I lost the forked repo for https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/pull/8438, so I closed that PR and opened this one with a properly set up repo in my GitHub in case any changes are requested.\r\n",

        "body": "This is a rewrite of `genpass` plugin. The new implementation has better performance and usability and fixes several bugs. It is backward-compatible.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] The PR title is descriptive.\r\n- [x] The PR doesn't replicate another PR which is already open.\r\n- [x] I have read the contribution guide and followed all the instructions.\r\n- [x] The code follows the code style guide detailed in the wiki.\r\n- [x] The code is mine or it's from somewhere with an MIT-compatible license.\r\n- [x] The code is efficient, to the best of my ability, and does not waste computer resources.\r\n- [x] The code is stable and I have tested it myself, to the best of my abilities.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\nThe following bugs have been fixed:\r\n\r\n- All generators ignored errors from external commands. For example, if `/usr/share/dict/words` was unreadable, `genpass-xkcd` would print \"0-\" as a password and return success.\r\n- `genpass-xkcd` was generating passwords with less than 128 bits of security margin in contradiction to documentation. The smaller the dictionary size, the weaker the passwords it was generating. For a dictionary with 27 words, `genpass-xkcd` was generating passwords with 93 bits of security margin (`log2(27!)`).\r\n- The source of random data used by `genpass-xkcd` was not cryptographically secure in contradiction to documentation. See: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Random-sources.html\r\n- `genpass-apple` could generate a password with non-ascii characters depending on user locale. For example, passwords could contain '\u0130' for users with Turkish locale.\r\n- `genpass-apple` didn't work with `ksh_arrays` shell option.\r\n- `genpass-xkcd` was printing spurious errors with `ksh_arrays` shell option.\r\n- `genpass-xkcd` was producing too short (weak) or too strong (long) and/or printing errors when `IFS` was set to non-default value.\r\n- All generators were printing fewer passwords than requested and returning success when passed a very large number as an argument.\r\n\r\n## Usability\r\n\r\nGenerators are now implemented as self-contained executable files. They can be invoked from scripts with no additional setup.\r\n\r\nGenerators no longer depend on external commands. The only dependencies are `/dev/urandom` and, for `genpass-xkcd`, `/usr/share/dict/words`.\r\n\r\nAll generators used to silently ignore all arguments after the first, and the first argument if it wasn't a number. For example, both `genpass-apple -2` and `genpass-apple -n 2` were generating one password and not printing any errors. Now these print an error and fail.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nThe time it takes to load the plugin has been greatly reduced. This translates into faster zsh startup when the plugin is enabled.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, two generators out of three have been sped up to a large degree while one generator (`genpass-xkcd`) has gotten slower. This is unlikely to matter one way or another unless generating a very large number of passwords. In the latter case `genpass-xkcd` is now also faster than it used to be.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows benchmark results from Linux x86-64 on i9-7900X. The numbers in the second and third columns show how many times a given command can be executed per second. Higher numbers are better.\r\n\r\ncommand                     | before (Hz) | after (Hz) | speedup |\r\n----------------------------|------------:|-----------:|--------:|\r\n`source genpass.plugin.zsh` |        4810 |      68700 |  +1326% |\r\n`genpass-apple`             |        30.3 |        893 |  +2846% |\r\n`genpass-monkey`            |         203 |       5290 |  +2504% |\r\n`genpass-xkcd`              |        34.4 |       14.5 |    -58% |\r\n`genpass-xkcd 1000`         |       0.145 |      0.804 |   +454% |\r\n",

This solves the bug where, for example, the user would have typed `echo '` and <kbd>Enter</kbd>, then zsh would be in PS2 waiting for the user to close the quote, and while the line would be empty, the user would press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, triggering the magic commands.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/9464#issuecomment-732957452\r\n\r\n### Fix 3: emulate user typing the magic command\r\n\r\nUse `$BUFFER` and `zle .accept-line` to make it behave nicely towards other zsh plugins.\r\n\r\nNOTE: this changes the behavior of the magic-enter widget: instead of leaving the prompt line empty, the output appearing below it and then redrawing the prompt, now the magic command will appear in the command prompt and \"type Enter\" as if the user did it themselves.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/9464#issuecomment-732412867\r\n\r\n### Fix 4: don't overwrite original accept-line widget wrappers\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/9464#issuecomment-732984761\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFixes #9464\r\n",

Following up on #9049 and #9091, I had an idea for a non-breaking way to let users specify the name of their main branch in a given repo: using a custom `git config` field called `omz.git.mainBranch` (which I don't think anyone would already be using for any other purpose).\r\n\r\nI adjusted `git_main_branch` to check this field first before falling back to its previous functionality, and I added a new function `set_main_branch` as a shortcut for `git config --local omz.git.mainBranch`. And I adjusted the plugin's readme to reflect these changes.\r\n\r\nIs this a good solution? Should `set_main_branch` be an alias instead of a function? Should it have a nicer, more abbreviated name? I figured it'd be a command people wouldn't be typing too often, since you can pretty much set it and forget it for any individual repo that doesn't already use `main` or `master`.\r\n\r\n### Updated `git_main_branch`:\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\n# Check if user specified main branch in config, then check if \"main\" exists,\r\n# then default to \"master\"\r\nfunction git_main_branch() {\r\n  local main_branch=$(git config omz.git.mainBranch)\r\n  if [[ -n \"$main_branch\" ]]; then\r\n    echo \"$main_branch\"\r\n  elif [[ -n \"$(git branch --list main)\" ]]; then\r\n    echo main\r\n  else\r\n    echo master\r\n  fi\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New `set_main_branch`:\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\n# Set the name of the main branch in a local repository\r\nfunction set_main_branch() {\r\n  git config --local omz.git.mainBranch \"$1\"\r\n}\r\n```",

I imagine some might think that `gdu` should simply be `git diff @{u}`, and so maybe this should be `gduu` or something.... but my vote would be simply `gdu` because it seems more useful to me.\r\n",

This uses parameter expansion to perform a word split on LBUFFER and then match on the last entry in the array, so it will filter expansion regardless of where the alias occurs in the line.\r\n\r\nCurrently, given:\r\n```\r\nalias grep='grep --color=auto --exclude-dir={.bzr,CVS,.git,.hg,.svn,.idea,.tox}'\r\nGLOBALIAS_FILTER_VALUES=(grep)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn initial grep won't be expanded (because LBUFFER=\"grep\" and that matches an item in GLOBALIAS_FILTER_VALUES):\r\n```\r\n> grep forthis file.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut a piped grep would (because LBUFFER='curl mywebsite.com | grep' which doesn't match):\r\n```\r\n> curl mywebsite.com | \\grep --color=auto --exclude-dir=.bzr --exclude-dir=CVS --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.hg --exclude-dir=.svn --exclude-dir=.idea --exclude-dir=.tox forthis\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, `$LBUFFER` is replaced by `${${(A)=LBUFFER}[-1]}`, which does the following:\r\n\r\n- =LBUFFER performs a word split on LBUFFER using the rules for SH_WORD_SPLIT\r\n- (A) converts the substitution into an array expression, even if it would otherwise be scalar (this is necessary so that subscripting works even when there's only one word; without it you'd only get the last character if LBUFFER was a single word)\r\n- [-1] returns the last item in the array, which is the string right before the cursor.\r\n\r\nAnd thus GLOBALIAS_FILTER_VALUES now works anywhere in the command.\r\n\r\n## Standards checklist:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill with an x the ones that apply.

To reproduce the issue I am talking about, create a new git repo, make changes, say `touch` a file, and notice that no marker gets added next to the branch name in the prompt until you either execute any `git` command or open a new tab. The other issue of not detecting changes outside the current directory can be reproduced by making a change, say create a new file, then create a new directory and `cd` into it.",

This will also hopefully get the discord server just a bit more active. I also added a field for WSL1/2 that way we can easily categorize rather it is a Windows bug or a Oh My Zsh issue.\r\n- Feature Request Template\r\nI added a field that is consisted with aliases and themes that way they are consisted throughout that entire file. I also added a field for related issues that this feature request could be related too. This can help us make a PR that would close issues and PRs at the same time.\r\n- Added MLH Theme\r\nSince we are involved in the MLH-Fellowship fellows created a MLH theme! This theme is to be used a Hackathons and by other Fellows that are involved in the fellowship. This will immediately be used world wide and it is the perfect theme for hackathon environments.\r\n- Updated README\r\nI only did a few simple changes to the README. I added a few links that were missing but were on the website so now we are being more consistent among our platforms. I also bumped the ZSH and GIT suggestions, since I did some research on the different version and ZSH had a few bugs that are now fixed in the minimum requirement. I also discovered a GIT issue that breaks installation and that is now fixed in the minimum requirement. \r\n\r\n## Other comments:\r\nThis will helps users and Hackathon attenders\r\n...\r\n",

The code style says to use 2 spaces indentation, but all of the commits of this file use 4 spaces indentation. I don't know which one to choose.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't know whether there is a need to add `-n $EDITOR &&` in front of `$BUFFER == sudoedit\\ *`.",

On the other hand I understand that this is crucial to my security and I am really thankful to the one who introduced that prompt feature. To make it more convenient I made a small improvement that allows you to accept .env at given path once. I think it is a good compromise between convenience and security.\r\n\r\nWith oss love,\r\nJ\u0119drzej\r\n\r\n## Standards checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] The PR title is descriptive.\r\n- [x] The PR doesn't replicate another PR which is already open.\r\n- [x] I have read the contribution guide and followed all the instructions.\r\n- [x] The code follows the code style guide detailed in the wiki.\r\n- [x] The code is mine or it's from somewhere with an MIT-compatible license.\r\n- [x] The code is efficient, to the best of my ability, and does not waste computer resources.\r\n- [x] The code is stable and I have tested it myself, to the best of my abilities.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n\r\n- New feature for **dotenv** plugin: you can ask plugin to accept given .env file once\r\n  - When prompted if you want to load .env file, you can now type 'a' which will add absolute path to a list of accepted .env files\r\n  - Once path is added to the list, the plugin will not ask again if you want to load this particular .env\r\n  - The list is kept in a file `$ZSH/dotenv-agree.list`.\r\n  - Path to the list file is configurable via `$ZSH_DOTENV_AGREE_LIST_FILE` variable\r\n",

Per [the README for the v2 branch](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/v2/README.rst#command-completion), this can be enabled with a wrapper in zsh, or with the `complete` command that ohmyzsh already supports. \r\n\r\nI realise I have a hardcoded path in the check, but both the [Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html) and [macOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html) installation instructions highlight that this is where a symlink to the actual binary will be.",

        "body": "Inspired by antonbabenko/awsp@6588191, I added Role Delegation and MFA support as per [AWS IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#delegate-using-roles) to AWS plugin. No changes to the command syntax, everything happens behind the scenes. This is especially useful when MFA is enforced for AWS accounts.\r\n\r\nThe newly supported use case is when a user has one main IAM account protected by MFA that can assume multiple roles elsewhere, and those roles are configured in .aws/config. The script will now assume a role and set additional environment variables automatically, including support for [external id] and MFA authentication with session length. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) and [MFA](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/).",

        "body": "Hi everyone \ud83d\udc4b, and thank you so much for this kick-ass project! \r\n\r\nThe emoji plugin hasn't been updated in about a year, and the emojis that it was supporting were pretty outdated. I spent the afternoon trying to update it, but in the process, I ended up re-writing significant parts of the plugin. Let me know what you think of it.\r\n\r\nHere is the (relatively complete) list of changes:\r\n1. **`emoji-data.txt`**: The previous file was very old, and has been replaced by the [current](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/12.0/emoji-test.txt) Emoji spec (Emoji 12, January 2019). This new spec, however, was formatted very differently from the previous one. This led me...\r\n2. **New `update_emoji` script**: ... to rewrite the parsing script in Python (I am more comfortable with Python than Perl). The mechanism is the same, but I added a few things to it.\r\n3. **Keeping up with Emoji 12**: To state the obvious, _a lot_ has changed in the emoji world over the past few years. This means that the current Emoji spec is much more complex than before. \r\n   - **Redundant Emojis**: Consider, for instance, that the same emoji can be expressed with different code points. To take an extreme example, the emoji \"Woman detective\" can be expressed with four (!) different combinations of unicode symbols. (\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f,\ud83d\udd75\u200d\u2640\ufe0f,\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640,\ud83d\udd75\u200d\u2640 for the record.) In that kind of case, the Unicode consortium determines that one of these code points is the gold standard (\"full-qualified\", in their parlance), and the other not so much (\"minimally-qualified\", \"unqualified\", and so on.) I made sure that the script took that into account. Concretely, all the code points are registered in the `$emoji` array, but with a qualification attached to their names if necessary. (`$emoji[woman_detective] $emoji[woman_detective_unqualified] $emoji[woman_detective_unqualified_1] $emoji[woman_detective_unqualified_2]`, in this case.)\r\n   - **Skin tone / Hair style**: Integrating skin tone and hair style is relatively straightforward. One is still able to make custom combinations by hand, but it gets tricky quickly. All the listed combinations on the Unicode spec are here, though. Moreover, I took the liberty of removing some experimental variables that were planning for this feature (`$emoji2`, for instance).\r\n   - **Non-compatible systems**: Not every OS has been updated with the new emojis, so there will be some weird stuff on your screen if you try to display the newest additions. But hopefully, with this integration, Emoji 12 will be available to the torrent of new macOS users who will be coming this fall.\r\n4. **Automated `$emoji_groups`**: Previously, the `$emoji_groups` associative array, the one that triages emojis into groups for the `display_emoji` command, was hand-coded in `emoji.plugin.zsh`. I found it much easier to automate the process, so these groups are now defined in the python script.\r\n   - **Three groups added**: In addition to programmatically define the emoji groups, I added two new ones: flags, hands, and people. But the latter two are pretty massive in size, which defeats the purpose of the `display_emoji <group>` command a little...\r\n    - **Still more work**: There is still work to be done on which groups to define though. The classification until now was OK when the number of emojis was manageable, but with almost 4,000 emojis nowadays, the classification should be re-thought.\r\n   - **But there is more data**: On the plus side, the current Emoji spec classifies everything into groups and subgroups, which means more granularity to classify if we want to.\r\n5. **Gemoji integration**: It was listed a relative priority on the README, and it was relatively easy to do. I downloaded their JSON database, which is now located at `gemoji_db.json`. Every time an emoji is considered by the script, it looks into that database, and if it finds a nickname, an alias that was not already in the spec, it takes it into account (lines 155-158, 184-187 of `update_emoji.py`). Concretely, that means that the same emoji can be accessed through multiple labels: \ud83d\ude0b, for instance, is `$emoji[face_savoring_food]` and `$emoji[yum]`.\r\n6. **Country Codes**: Also high on the priority list, adding country codes as aliases for flags. I added them with the help of an external Python library, `country_converter`. It is an annoying library with a lot of logging, but it works well and has almost every flag covered. This, in turn, means that \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddff, for instance, can be accessed through multiple labels: `$emoji_flags[Mozambique] / [MZ] / [MOZ] / [mozambique]`\r\n7. **README**: I updated the README accordingly, although I tried to leave as untouched as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that's it! Tell me what you think. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for making this plugin in the first place, I really just polished it.",

I personally prefer the nord- prefix, but if nvpn would be preferred, I will change it.\r\n\r\n## Completion\r\n\r\n | Command            | Completion of..                                                                                         |\r\n | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n | nordvpn            | All below commands, as well as `--help`, `-h`, `--version` and `-v`.                                    |\r\n | .. cities          | `--help` and `-h`                                                                                       |\r\n | .. connect         | Group names, Country names and City names if following a Country, `--help` and `-h`.                    |\r\n | .. countries       | `--help` and `-h`                                                                                       |\r\n | .. disconnect      | `--help` and `-h`                                                                                       |\r\n | .. groups          | `--help` and `-h`                                                                                       |\r\n | .. login           | `--username`, `-u`, `--password`, `-p`, `--help` and `-h`                                               |\r\n | .. logout          | `--help` and `-h`                                                                                       |\r\n | .. set             | `autoconnect`, `cybersec`, `dns`, `killswitch`, `notify`, `obfuscate` and `protocol`, `--help` and `-h` |\r\n | .. set autoconnect | `off`, `on`, `--help` and `-h`. `on` is followed by the same completion options as connect.             |\r\n | .. set cybersec    | `on`, `off`, `--help` and `-h`                                                                          |\r\n | .. set dns         | `off`, `--help` and `-h`                                                                                |\r\n | .. set killswitch  | `on`, `off`, `--help` and `-h`                                                                          |\r\n | .. set notify      | `on`, `off`, `--help` and `-h`                                                                          |\r\n | .. set obfuscate   | `on`, `off`, `--help` and `-h`                                                                          |\r\n | .. set protocol    | `TCP`, `UDP`, `--help` and `-h`                                                                         |\r\n | .. settings        | `--help` and `-h`                                                                                       |\r\n | .. status          | `--help` and `-h`                                                                                       |\r\n | .. whitelist       | `--help` and `-h`                                                                                       |\r\n                         \r\n## Aliases\r\n\r\n | Alias        | Command              | Description                                           |\r\n | ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\r\n | nord         | `nordvpn`            | Alias for nordvpn                                     |\r\n | nordcit      | `nordvpn cities`     | Shows a list of cities where servers are available    |\r\n | nordc        | `nordvpn connect`    | Connects you to VPN                                   |\r\n | nordcout     | `nordvpn countries`  | Shows a list of countries where servers are available |\r\n | nordd        | `nordvpn disconnect` | Disconnects you from VPN                              |\r\n | nordgrp      | `nordvpn groups`     | Shows a list of available server groups               |\r\n | nordl        | `nordvpn login`      | Logs you in                                           |\r\n | nordlo       | `nordvpn logout`     | Logs you out                                          |\r\n | nordset      | `nordvpn set`        | Sets a configuration option                           |\r\n | nordsettings | `nordvpn settings`   | Shows current settings                                |\r\n | nordst       | `nordvpn status`     | Shows connection status                               |\r\n | nordwh       | `nordvpn whitelist`  | Adds or removes an option from a whitelist            |\r\n | nordh        | `nordvpn help`       | Shows a list of commands or help for one command      |\r\n\r\n",

An update was needed to point to the new URL when the user runs \"frontend angularjs ...\".\r\n\r\n### What I did\r\nI updated the README.md of the frontend-search plugin to include the new URL for angularjs, and made the appropriate change in frontend-search.plugin.zsh to point to the new URL 'https://angular.io/?search='. I also updated the code that adds a + between the search terms when appending them to the URL to be encoded (so + now becomes %20). I did this because the new search URL for angular drops the search terms in the angular search bar with the + included, instead of a space. I verified that this does not break any of the existing searches we have.\r\n\r\n### What this fixes\r\nFixes #7802",

Popular examples are https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions or https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting for plugins and https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt for themes. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if these custom plugins and themes would smoothly integrate into OMZ's update process. The scope of this PR is to add this functionality.\r\n\r\n### Comments\r\n- I don't want to steal anybody's work, most of the effort was done by @benwaffle in the corresponding issue. \r\n- I think it is a good choice to add the possibility for automatic updates but disable it by default. Users should take a conscious decision (and be aware of it's implications) when choosing to enable automatic updates of custom plugins and themes.\r\n- These are my first steps with OMZ happy to receive feedback and comments.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nI am not entirely sure, if a feature like this has it's place in OMZ.",

        "body": "CC: @ncanceill \r\n> Migrating to `git stash push`\r\n> As of late October 2017, there has been extensive discussion on the Git mailing list, wherein the command `git stash save` is being deprecated in favour of the existing alternative `git stash push`. The main reason for this is that `git stash push` introduces the option of stashing selected pathspecs, something `git stash save` does not support.\r\n> \r\n> `git stash save` is not going away any time soon, so don\u2019t worry about it suddenly disappearing. But you might want to start migrating over to the push alternative for the new functionality.\r\n\r\nThe Pro Git book, in the chapter about Stashing and Cleaning, now reports the above note. The new command was introduced with Git 2.13, which came out 2 years ago. I'm using the latest version of Git and although `stash save` is still present in the `git-stash`'s man page, `stash push` has taken its place in the command synopsis, as a sign that the latter should be preferred.\r\n```\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n       git stash list [<options>]\r\n       git stash show [<stash>]\r\n       git stash drop [-q|--quiet] [<stash>]\r\n       git stash ( pop | apply ) [--index] [-q|--quiet] [<stash>]\r\n       git stash branch <branchname> [<stash>]\r\n       git stash [push [-p|--patch] [-k|--[no-]keep-index] [-q|--quiet]\r\n                    [-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [-m|--message <message>]\r\n                    [--] [<pathspec>...]]\r\n       git stash clear\r\n       git stash create [<message>]\r\n       git stash store [-m|--message <message>] [-q|--quiet] <commit>\r\n```\r\nThe two commands have mostly the same interface, except that with `stash push` the message is supplied via the `-m`/`--message` flag, while with `stash save` the message is the main argument of the `stash` command and requires no flags.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I think it's pretty safe to change the `gsta` alias to `git stash push`: the switch should be pretty seamless and hard to misuse as `stash push` will complain if a message is supplied with no flags as it expects a list of pathspecs.\r\n\r\nFixes #7474",

For example, I will often run `gfa` (ie, `git fetch --all --prune`) when starting work on a project.

This is also useful if I'm switching branches and may forget to check if there are more commits in the remote branch than I have in my local. As a bonus, if I'm done working on something and have not yet pushed these changes to the remote, the icon is a nice gentle reminder.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds an icon to the prompt if the local branch is forward, behind, or has diverged from its remote tracking branch. When the branch has no remote branch associated, nothing is displayed.\r\n\r\n![screenshot_2018-10-03_20-43-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/334786/46434941-fd8b3200-c74c-11e8-82c2-b606106f77bf.png)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to take feedback on this. I've tried to pick icons that make sense, but am happy to change these and/or the position in the prompt as needed.\r\n\r\nThis is a modification to the @agnoster theme.",

        "body": "This commit improves several aspects of the plugin:\r\n\r\n*   Get `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` directly from `gpgconf` and only when the current shell is not a child of `gpg-agent`.\r\n\r\n    From [`man gpg-agent`](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Agent-Examples.html#Agent-Examples):\r\n    > If you enabled the Ssh Agent Support, you also need to tell ssh about it by adding this to your init script:\r\n    > \r\n    >     unset SSH_AGENT_PID\r\n    >     if [ \"${gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by:-0}\" -ne $$ ]; then\r\n    >       export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\"$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)\"\r\n    >     fi\r\n    The use of the `if` test here is explained [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG#Set_SSH_AUTH_SOCK):\r\n    > **Note**: The test involving the `gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by` variable is for the case where the agent is started as `gpg-agent --daemon /bin/sh`, in which case the shell inherits the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` variable from the parent, `gpg-agent`.\r\n\r\n*   Update the agent's tty before each command execution to ensure that passphrase prompts are displayed in the correct tty.\r\n\r\n    This fixes a bug where if the plugin is used together with the `tmux` plugin and ssh support is enabled, `ssh` passphrase prompts will be displayed in the incorrect `tty` in some cases, causing the tmux window to close with a `server lost` message.\r\n\r\n    The fix is implemented according to [`man gpg-agent`](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Agent-Options.html#Agent-Options):\r\n    > Note: in case the gpg-agent receives a signature request, the user might need to be prompted for a passphrase, which is necessary for decrypting the stored key. Since the ssh-agent protocol does not contain a mechanism for telling the agent on which display/terminal it is running, gpg-agent\u2019s ssh-support will use the TTY or X display where gpg-agent has been started. To switch this display to the current one, the following command may be used:\r\n    > \r\n    >     gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye\r\n\r\n*   In addition, according to [`man gpg-agent`](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT.html#Invoking-GPG_002dAGENT), `gpg-connect-agent` can also be used to start `gpg-agent`:\r\n    > The agent is automatically started on demand by gpg, gpgsm, gpgconf, or gpg-connect-agent. Thus there is no reason to start it manually. In case you want to use the included Secure Shell Agent you may start the agent using:\r\n    > \r\n    >     gpg-connect-agent /bye\r\n    So we can start `gpg-agent` using this command without the need to check if it is already running.\r\n\r\n@robbyrussell @mcornella Please review and provide feedback. Thank you!\r\n\r\nFixes #7082",

        "body": "This PR tries to make `last-working-dir` work more nicely with other shell plugins that change directory internally under subshells, e.g. [shrink-path](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/shrink-path/shrink-path.plugin.zsh#L96-L124).\r\n\r\n`shrink-path` relies on the subshell exit to return the user to the correct working dir, but subshell exit does not trigger `chpwd_functions`. As a result, `last-working-dir` gets confused, recording the subshell's last working dir, and forgetting my actual working dir.\r\n\r\nThis PR works around the issue by disabling `chpwd_last_working_dir` in subshells.\r\n\r\n#### Extra Details...\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal reproduction of the current symptom:\r\n```bash\r\n> cd /usr\r\n> cd /var\r\n> pwd\r\n/var\r\n> cat \"$ZSH_CACHE_DIR/last-working-dir\"\r\n/var\r\n```\r\nUp to here everything is normal--`last-working-dir` always records my current working dir. This is as expected.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n> cd /usr\r\n> (cd /var)\r\n> pwd\r\n/usr\r\n> cat \"$ZSH_CACHE_DIR/last-working-dir\"\r\n/var\r\n```\r\nHere `last-working-dir` has diverged, since it has followed the subshell, but my actual session has not. This is probably not the desired behavior.\r\n\r\nHere's a final example, running my modifications\r\n```bash\r\n> cd /usr\r\n> (cd /var)\r\n> pwd\r\n/usr\r\n> cat \"$ZSH_CACHE_DIR/last-working-dir\"\r\n/usr\r\n```\r\n`last-working-dir` stays in sync with my session, because the dir change under the subshell is ignored. This is my preferred behavior.",

We use this as the test to see if we need to start the agent.\r\n\r\nAdding -use-standard-socket to starting the daemon means that older versions of gpg-agent behave in the same was as newer versions. \r\n\r\nI applied the same idea for the ssh agent. We can check if we have an ssh socket, if so then we set the SSH_AUTH_SOCKET - The reason for this is that newer versions of gpg-agent default to enabling ssh-agent therefore checking for the config variable wasn't reliable.\r\n\r\nHope this all makes sense.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nChris",

The motivation for this can be seen in an earlier discussion: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/5356#issuecomment-344048908\r\n\r\nIn addition to simply replacing the code, it improves the script such that it can search using the new Spotify API that requires authentication.\r\n\r\nCloses: #6118, https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify/issues/84\r\nMakes redundant: #6170, #6232, #6345, #6291\r\n\r\n## Specific changes\r\n\r\n- Removes the old spotify function and replaces it with a copy from the upstream project (now as a separate file). I have separated it out to make it easier for me to keep it up-to-date with the upstream project.\r\n- Includes this file using `source`. Not sure if this is a blessed thing to do.\r\n- Adds the original project's copyright permission as an acknowledgement in this plugin's README.\r\n\r\nI am open to discussion and improving how these changes are implemented. I have just submitted a simple, functional implementation. \ud83d\ude05 \r\n\r\ncc: @robbyrussell ",

For people with lots of history, this takes a really long time and makes the terminal feel much more sluggish. If I read the intention of this correctly, it seems like the steeef theme only intended to read the last command.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes that (and uses `fc` directly instead of `history` which is an alias for `fc -l`). It also uses `whence` to expand any aliases so that if you type `gst`, for example, it'll expands to, say, `git status` and the `PR_GIT_UPDATE` environment variable will be properly set.\r\n\r\nOne notable issue is that this may feel like it breaks a piece of `steeef`'s functionality to some. Per intention, `steeef` was only supposed to update the prompt for untracked files if a `git` or `svn` command was issued. However, because of the broken functionality, if you ever had a `git` command in your history, it would check every time and always update the prompt. So, while it might be much faster and technically accurate according to what seems to be the original intention, some users may be confused about the new behavior.\r\n\r\n@steeef thoughts?",

This looks to be an issue of stemming from initializing two separate pyenv installations into the same shell. The first one is initialized based on the user's `PATH`, and the second is initialized based on the plugin's search order. This PR would change the pyenv plugin to also initialize based on the user's `PATH`, it would initialize the same pyenv. I can't say for sure without recreating the user's issue.)\r\n",

        "body": "Adding a plugin that I have been using locally for some time and wanted to share \r\nwith you if you are interested.\r\n\r\nThis plugin listens to pwd updates and searches for a node_modules directory in\r\ncurrent directory and upwards. For the first node_modules folder found (the\r\ndeepest one), we automatically add its .bin folder to PATH (node_modules/.bin).\r\n\r\n## motivation\r\n\r\nWe try to keep project dependencies as isolated as possible and we avoid\r\ninstalling them globally to our machines. One such dependency is\r\n[Flow](https://flow.org/). Text editors with Flow extensions search for the `flow`\r\nbinary on path. Thus, before opening our editor, we must first remember to add\r\nthe project's node_module/.bin folder to path.\r\n\r\nThe reason we created this plugin was automate this step to safe little time\r\nwhen doing our development.\r\n\r\n## example\r\n\r\n\t\u279c  ~ tree ~/project\r\n\t/Users/hlysig/project\r\n\t\u251c\u2500\u2500 node_modules\r\n\t\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 flow\r\n\t\t ...\r\n\t\u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\r\n\t\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\r\n\t\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 server\r\n\t\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.js\r\n\t\u2514\u2500\u2500 yarn.lock\r\n\r\n\t\u279c  ~ cd ~/project/src/server\r\n\tFound node_modules in /Users/hlysig/project, adding to path\r\n\t\u279c  server which flow\r\n\t/Users/hlysig/project/node_modules/.bin/flow",

But the prompt grows too long when the directory path is deep.  I've seen various other attempts at fixing this adhoc and I thought having this available in a single place shared from `oh-my-zsh` is appropriate.  Also, this is a copy of the original with the fix to be backwards compatible for other users still wanting to keep the full $PWD path for their prompt printout.",

User activates Python 3.5 virtualenv where he installs IPython 3.5. After activating the environment, one expects `ipython` to run the version of 3.5, which does not happen by default. Instead, IPython 2.7 is used, which in counter-intuitive and often causes problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this problem.",

Since `[skip ci]` is used by the likes of TravisCI, CircleCI, GitLab CI and others I think it's fair to include here. Feedback is welcome!

See https://github.com/joshka/zsh-completions/commit/31b4e82887626eee236a9806ec9c4f5dee90056c\n\nA copy of the relevant part of the commit message of the above is included here:\n\nThe original plugin suffers from the following issues (IMO):\n1. it is part of oh-my-zsh which some have chosen not to use\n2. it acts as a script overriding the existing brew completion rather than as a\nstandard autoloadable file, this means it must be manually installed rather than\nautomatically installed as part of compinit.\n\nThe changes from the plugin are to fix item 2, as well as update the commands to\nthose current in homebrew cask. This change relies on a change pending in the\nhomebrew completion to allow it to call subcommand completions (see\nhttps://github.com/joshka/brew/commit/6b010c5700095685bad6797038e83ef558df5104)\nand hence should not be merged until that has been merged.\n\nIdeally, this completion would be installed as part of the homebrew cask\ninstallation, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to do so as it is\nhomebrew cask is installed as a homebrew tap. It also doesn't really fit in the\nhomebrew main repo for similar reasons.\n\nSee related PRs:\nhttps://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/pull/430\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/407\n",

        "body": "Ready for testing\r\n\r\nThis is an all-encompassing PR to fix once and for all all issues related to the OMZ installer, as well as adding features requested many times.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n#### `zshrc` file mangling\r\n\r\n- [x] #2499: Some minor alteration concerning `.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`\r\n- [x] #4390: Please, oh please, ask, or at least warn, about overwriting ~/.zshrc on installation PR\r\n- [x] #4391: installer: use timestamped backups to preserve all old zshrcs\r\n\r\nFixes #2499. Fixes #4390. Fixes #4391.\r\n\r\n#### Change of default shell issues\r\n\r\n- [x] #4131: Does not change default shell to zsh on NixOS\r\n- [x] #4564: Handle systems where /etc/shells does not exist\r\n- [x] [#4818](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/4818#issuecomment-178106951): installer doesn't check if the zsh obtained from `/etc/shells` exists\r\n- [x] #5277: Install script set my shell to /usr/local/bin/zsh instead of /bin/zsh\r\n- [x] #6569: Patch for detect shell file in Solus OS\r\n- [x] #7254: Make sure the line begins with a (forward) slash ('/')\r\n\r\nFixes #4131. Fixes #4564. Fixes #4818. Fixes #5277. Fixes #6569. Fixes #7254.\r\n\r\n#### Restore default shell\r\n\r\n- [x] #3447: oh-my-zsh uninstall.sh issues - switch back to bash is unsatisfactory\r\n- [x] #6119: uninstall zsh didn't revert shell back to bash on OSX\r\n- [x] #6299: Uninstalling oh my zsh does NOT restore previous default shell\r\n- [x] #6356: Fix for #6299: restore previous default shell with uninstall\r\n- [x] #6608: Uninstall restores now the original shell\r\n\r\nFixes #3447. Fixes #6119. Fixes #6299. Fixes #6356. Fixes #6608.\r\n\r\n#### `$PATH` management\r\n\r\n- [x] #1359: Do not force PATH in the installer\r\n- [x] #2586: install.sh: `PATH=` with no `$PATH` inside\r\n- [x] #2589: Respect original PATH definitions on install\r\n- [x] #4317: Should export PATH contain $PATH in .zshrc?\r\n- [x] #4925: Remove undesirable hardcoding of PATH into zshrc\r\n\r\nFixes #1359. Fixes #2586. Fixes #4925. Closes #2589. Closes #4317.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n#### Skip change of default shell\r\n\r\n- [x] #4261: Prevent shell change during setup\r\n- [x] #7100: Suggestion: add a flag to bypass setting zsh as default shell\r\n- [x] #7266: Adds skip-chsh flag to switch login shell step\r\n- [x] #7721: Installation script shouldn't alter default shell\r\n- [x] #7865: Make setting the default shell during installation optional\r\n\r\nFixes #4261. Fixes #7100. Fixes #7266. Fixes #7721. Fixes #7865.\r\n\r\nThe installer respects the environment variable `CHSH`. Set to `no`, it will skip the chsh step. It also reads the flag `--skip-chsh` which has the same effect. For instance, these two are equivalent:\r\n```sh\r\nCHSH=no sh install.sh\r\nsh install.sh --skip-chsh\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Don't run zsh after install\r\n\r\n- [x] #4393: [Discuss] What should installer behavior be, esp wrt launching new shells?\r\n- [x] #5002: add a way to not launch zsh after finishing\r\n- [x] #5853: Add a flag to prevent the \"launch\" of zsh\r\n- [x] #5893: Allow batch mode installation\r\n- [x] #6547: Add support for --silent option in install.sh script\r\n- [x] #7790: Add non-interactive option to install script\r\n\r\nFixes #4393. Fixes #5002. Fixes #5853. Fixes #5893. Fixes #6547. Fixes #7790.\r\n\r\nAs in the skip-chsh feature above, the installer respects the variable `RUNZSH`, which when set to `no` will skip the zsh call when the install is done. The flag `--unattended` also sets `RUNZSH=no`, as well as setting `CHSH=no`. So these two are equivalent:\r\n```sh\r\nRUNZSH=no CHSH=no sh install.sh\r\nsh install.sh --unattended\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Forks\r\n\r\n- [x] #3648: Installer: add ability to install from forked repos\r\n- [x] #5628: Zsh installer defaults to main repo even if installed from fork sync\r\n- [x] #7496: make installation script configurable for forks\r\n\r\nFixes #3648. Fixes #5628. Fixes #7496.\r\n\r\nThe installer respects the following environment variables, that can be set up when calling it with `VAR=value sh install.sh`.\r\n\r\n- `REPO`: value in the form of `owner/project`. Useful for forks in GitHub (defaults to `robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).\r\n- `BRANCH`: default branch to check out once the clone has finished (defaults to master).\r\n- `REMOTE`: full remote URL (supersedes `REPO` if set). You could for example choose an ssh remote URL, like `git@github.com:user/oh-my-zsh`, or another fork from GitLab or Bitbucket.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n- [x] #5194: installer: git clone using ssh URL if https fails\r\n- [x] #5320: Greatly improve the OMZ install.sh\r\n- [x] #7007: Replace the current shell with the new ZSH instance\r\n\r\nFixes #5320. Fixes #7007.\r\nCloses #5194.\r\n",

This causes a problem when the current\ntag is equal to another tag or branch and the output looks like this:\n`(HEAD, tag: foo, origin/master)` and  the tagname gets set to\n`tag: foo, origin/master`.  This breaks the whole script because its\noutput is space delimited and GIT_AHEAD which is supposed to be an\ninteger gets set to `origin/master` (branch also get set to `foo,`\ninstead of `foo`, but it's not as big of a problem).  To fix this we\nchange the regex to be nongreedy so that it will only grab one item from\nthe list and let the closing match either `,`(comma space) or `)`.  We\nalso have to use a lookahead since we can't just drop 1 character (`,`\nis 2 characters).\n",

SchemaCrawler has a good mix of useful features for data governance. You can search for database schema objects using regular expressions, and output the schema and data in a readable text format. The output serves for database documentation, and is designed to be diff-ed against other database schemas. SchemaCrawler also generates schema diagrams. You can execute scripts in any standard scripting language against your database. You can find potential schema design issues with lint.\n## Autocomplete addition\n\nI wanted to create a standard autocomplete script, but sice i discovered oh-my-zsh, i'm a big fan of it : it's working like a charm, has a tone of plugins so i wanted to add my contribution.\nHoepully this PR will be accepted. If not, please explain why and i'll change the source code.\n\nFind below an example of live running auto-complete on my workstation :\n\n![tty](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5235127/13907828/ee572f8c-ef4a-11e5-92df-3dc6f601f3d6.gif)\n\nIn case you would like to manually test it by yourself, you can get a debian installer : \n\nhttps://github.com/adriens/schemacrawler-deb/releases/latest\n\n... and then just add `schemacrawler` to your plugins\n## Others to come\n\nI'm using some other tools which do not yet have autocompletion. If i did nit apply good practices, please feel free to comment the PR so i can improve my plugin.\n## Thanks\n\nThank you for your great software, we are big fans, i'm showing it around me.\n",

The problem with this is that it seems to always be set to the Beta version of Xcode if Xcode is installed.\n## Suggestion:\n\nThis PR proposes getting the version of Xcode to use from the `xcode-select` tool which is more commonly used to switch between versions of the Xcode command line tools. (Similar to rbenv but for Xcode version) This parameter is more likely to reflect a developers preference for which version of Xcode they would like to use for development. \n## Technical notes\n\nBy default the `xcode-select` tool return the full path to the Xcode binary, often \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\", while `open -a` expects an Application path. Here we have used bash's parameter expansion to discard the `/Contents/Developer` part of the path. \n",

        "body": "Over the last week I've started using gpg-agent and was experiencing issues #2121 and #2496 without knowing what exactly is happening. Finally narrowed it down to this plugin so thought I might take a shot at it:\n\nI originally wrote a check just to see if SSH_AUTH_SOCK or SSH_AGENT_PID ( `[[ -n $VAR ]]` ) is set and if it is, it'll start without ssh support. Reason being if those variables are set then either ssh-agent or gpg-agent is already running so you probably don't want that overwritten. This would work with OSX as well since the built in ssh-agent will still set the variable without actually showing itself as a \"ssh-agent process\" (I'm still annoyed by this being built in, but that's beside the point). Something like `[[ -n $SSH_AUTH_SOCK ]]` would work well for this.\n\nHowever, I ended up changing this for what I think is a better solution.\n\nI saw with the ssh-agent plugin that you could set arguments with zstyle. So I just set one up with this plugin as well which makes it so that it's off by default and that you should explicitly set it. This should solve issues involving gpg-agent overriding the variables needed for ssh-agent to do it's thing and is preferable in pretty much all situations i.e. if you really prefer gpg-agent then you absolutely wouldn't mind it overriding the variables set by ssh-agent, so why check for them in the first place? Just flip a switch.\n\nI'd like to add that I really don't like the ssh support feature for gpg-agent. It doesn't bring anything new to the table as your SSH key is already symmetrically encrypted anyway and the only benefit I can think of is saving yourself a process. I honestly don't think it should be enabled unless you know you want it, even if there isn't ANY ssh-agent daemon running because it adds complexity to something that is pretty unrelated in most cases. It honestly seems like a case of feature creep to me.\n\nLastly, if this solution isn't okay I can PR my aforementioned one if you want. Just let me know.\n\nFIxes #2121\nFixes #2496\n",

Instead of simply disabling the automatic title and setting the fixed name, I wanted to set an environment variable so that, when set, the window would stop automatically changing. I was surprised that there was no other way from stopping the auto-title from updating other that disabling it from being loaded. \n\nI don't know if you would find this solution interesting, and neither if the changes on the screen plugin are truly needed (I've changed this quite awhile ago), but I wanted to contribute if others would also think that this would be an interesting behavior.\n\nCheers,\nWerner.\n",

This is totally\nfine (as long as both the instructions and the script itself are served\nusing HTTPS), but the script should be written in a way such that it\ndoesn't start trying to actually _do_ anything until the very last line.\n\nThe reason is due to the way `curl` works: if the socket drops before the\nrequest is complete (server abruptly hangs up, client's internet flakes\nout, etc.), `curl` will return the partial data that it received. Here\nis an example of that:\n\n![partial file execution](https://cldup.com/qU_Mnh2GmT.png)\n\nA way this might cause issues for tools/install.sh is if the connection drops\nafter cloning but before the repository (L53-56). The .zshrc\nconfiguration will not be copied and the shell will not be changed, but\nif the user tries to run the install script again it will claim\noh-my-zsh is already installed (L31-39).\n\nWhile this is not a particularly dangerous error condition (the user can\njust delete .oh-my-zsh and re-run), it can certainly be confusing for\nnew users. This also helps future-proof the script for a time when it\nmight need to use a \"dangerous\" command, e.g. `rm`, and we want to make\nsure it happens in the most transactional way possible.\n",

If you're unfamiliar, the git plugin simply shows the clean prompt if a certain config flag is set (`oh-my-zsh.hide-dirty`). This approach has multiple benefits, the most important being that you can configure it per-repository.\n\nFinally, the multiple `in_hg` calls ended up calling `hg root` a lot. These were not super long calls on their own, but when we do it often we end up spending quite a bit of time calculating an answer we already know. To fix this I saved it in a local variable at the beginning of the `hg_prompt_info` call and remove it at the end.\n",

It's is one of the tenets of a [twelve-factor app](http://www.12factor.net). Anything that is likely to change between deployment environments, such as resource handles for databases or credentials for external services, should be extracted from the code into environment variables.\n\nThere already a lot of projects who embrace this type of configuration and `.env` file format:\n[Ruby dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)\n[Node.js dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)\n[PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)\n\nIt's also [recommended by Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local#set-up-your-local-environment-variables).\n\nHowever, these projects are not suitable for shell-heavy work. They are bound to their language platform. If you often need to run small scripts, different language tools or daemons from terminal it's much more comfortable to preload ENV vars into current shell session. This plugin helps to do that automatically.\n\nAlthough this plugin is very simple code-wise, I think it could be a part of oh-my-zsh core plugin list.\n\nREADME file included.\n",

This is both in the plugin (which can load NVM from multiple locations now) and `nvm_prompt_info()` (which just defers to the `nvm` command to determine if it's installed and what environment is active)\n- Uses `nvm current` to get version names that distinguish \"system\" and \"none\" Nodes from the specific versions installed in NVM.\n### lib/nvm.zsh\n\nUse `which nvm` and `nvm current` instead of a hardcoded path to the NVM install and `node -v`.\n\nThe `which rvm` makes it work regardless of where nvm is loaded from. \n\nSwitching to `nvm current` instead of `node -v` nvm's version strings, which distinguish the \"system\" and \"none\" NVM environments, instead of reporting the specific version of the system node.js or erroring, respectively. This lets you differentiate from the system-wide version of node (called \"system\") and an NVM-managed Node instance (called \"vX.Y.Z\") even if they happen to have the same versions of Node.\n### plugins/nvm\n\nSearches for NVM in multiple well-known locations.\n\nAdds support for optionally using NVM's own completion definitions, instead of the plugin's `_nvm`. I think we might want to switch over to that entirely in the future, or expand `_nvm` to match its functionality. Our `_nvm` is missing some options (which may only appear in some versions of NVM) and does not complete version names against the Node versions installed in NVM.\n\nAdds a README.\n",

Changes the following  plugins to use these new portable functions, instead of the Mac-only `pbcopy` command.\n- copyfile\n- copydir\n- coffee\n\nI put them in a core `lib/clipboard.zsh` file instead of a new plugin because this changes both multiple plugins to use these functions, and we don't have a way of specifying dependencies between plugins. Sticking them in another plugin would break `copydir`, `copyfile`, and `coffee` for their existing users.\n\nCC: @mbauhardt (author of copyfile and copydir) and @coopermaruyama (author of coffee) since their plugins are changed by this.\n\nThe `cloudapp` plugin (cc: @matthewmccullough) may also be able to be changed to use this instead of `pbcopy`. But I didn't make that change myself, because it is using a Ruby script which then shells out, and I don't know if that shell-out will always get `zsh` and have OMZ loaded in it. If nothing else, it could adapt the logic used here to a Ruby function for picking the clipboard command portably. \n\nI've tested on OS X 10.9.5 and Windows 7. Will test on Linux once I have a chance to get on a Linux box too.\n### Interaction Risks\n\nIntroduces new `clipcopy` and `clippaste` commands for all users. These command names aren't standard or part of widely installed programs from what I can tell, so it shouldn't mask any existing commands.\n\nUsers who have defined their own commands named `clipcopy` or `clippaste` outside OMZ will experience breakage due to the collision. We could change the names to `omz_clipcopy` and `omz_clippaste` to avoid the collision and potential breakage. But I think these might be useful interactive commands and the shorter names would be appropriate.\n",

This is done by disabling automatic line wrapping using terminfo's `rmam` sequence.\n\nIt uses `%F{red}` as well, instead of `\\e[31m` which might not be that bad for portability but it looks better and is clearer what the color is.\n\n---\n### Test\n\n**Instructions:** you need a prompt that is sufficiently big that it occupies almost all the line space. There are 5 completion dots, so you'll need to have a prompt that is `$COLUMNS - command length - 4` minimum to trigger the new line prompt redraw. You also need to uncomment the line `COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS=true` in your zshrc file to enable the feature.\n\nOnce that is in place, trigger the bad behavior with `command [TAB]` (it needs to be a command that hasn't been completed yet, I use `ls [TAB]`). The 5 dots will be printed and the prompt will be redrawn on the line below to accomodate for the extra 5 characters. \n\nAfter that, copy the new function definition and try to trigger the same behavior (you have to use a different command now or `exec zsh` to restart the shell). See that dots get printed but the prompt is not redrawn. \n\nHere's the new function definition:\n\n``` zsh\nexpand-or-complete-with-dots() {\n    # toggle line-wrapping off and back on again\n    [[ -n \"$terminfo[rmam]\" && -n \"$terminfo[smam]\" ]] && echoti rmam\n    print -Pn \"%F{red}......%f\"\n    [[ -n \"$terminfo[rmam]\" && -n \"$terminfo[smam]\" ]] && echoti smam\n\n    zle expand-or-complete\n    zle redisplay\n}\n```\n\n---\n### Results\n\n**LEFT:** _without_ fix. **RIGHT:** _with_ fix.\n<a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/25388?autoplay=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/25388.png\" width=\"294\"/></a> <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/25389?autoplay=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/25389.png\" width=\"294\"/></a>\n\n/cc @robbyrussell \n",

There's currently no mechanism to test if fbterm will start correctly  (see [fbterm#73](https://code.google.com/p/fbterm/issues/detail?id=73)). This means that if `fbterm` fails, the shell session will be closed, due to how `exec` works.~~\n\n~~Maybe a better solution is to get rid of the `exit` statement, which will make the `fbterm` error visible. On the other hand, if `fbterm` starts correctly, once the user logs out of it the first shell session will be open.~~\n\nNow it will only exit if `fbterm` finishes correctly. Remains to be checked that if `fbterm` encounters an error it will have a non-zero exit code.\n\nRelated: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/1598#issuecomment-125107789\n\ncc @adben @wzhd @zasdfgbnm\n",

This was due both to the multiple check calls of `$(in_hg)`, when using `$(hg_prompt_info)`, and to the programming of the `hg branch` command in mercurial.\n\nThe `hg id` command has a tendency to be quicker in the callback and, as a bonus, allows for greater detail to a mercurial repository status. I think the `$(hg_get_id)` is better suited for mercurial branching since the command can allow for multiple status outputs like `changeset`, `branch`, and `bookmarks`. It also gives a quick status reference change to the repository when in use.\n\nAs such, I took the liberty to truncate the multiple check calls and to also replace the `$(hg_get_branch_name)` function with `$(hg_get_id)` for `$(hg_prompt_info)`.\n",

This breaks anything that uses terminfo or application (\"transmit\") mode escape sequences for cursor key bindings, including key bindings in some other plugins.\n\nThis PR just removes those widgets entirely, because they're now defined (correctly, I think) in `lib/keybindings.zsh` and not needed in plugins any more. (As long as the intent is to enable application cursor mode; see Caveats.)\n\nPartially fixes #2735.\n### Caveats and Regressions\n\nThis fixes `vi-mode` so the terminal will be in \"application cursor\" aka \"transmit\" mode while editing the command line, instead of \"local\" mode.  This is how it is when OMZ is loaded but the `vi-mode` plugin is not. This allows key bindings made with the portable `terminfo` support to work.\n\nHowever, users that use `vi-mode` and have hardcoded keybindings that map the cursor key sequences that a terminal sends in \"local\" mode are currently relying in the current broken smkx/rmkx code to keep the keypad in \"local cursor\" mode. Those key bindings would break.\n\nSince terminfo supports portability to different terminals, and OMZ as a whole and other plugins seem to be moving toward using them, we may want to do this despite the breakage. This also seems to be where the zsh community as a whole is going: the zsh mailing lists seem to endorse `[sr]mkx`. And Ubuntu is shipping with an `/etc/zsh/zshrc` that enables it by default.\n### Interaction with prompt overwriting and `zle reset-prompt`\n\nI _think_ the `zle reset-prompt` and `zle -R` were only needed on the `zle-keymap-select`, so they won't be missed from the other widgets (the `lib/keybindings.zsh` version doesn't use them). I've tested this out with the combination of `vi-mode` and `per-directory-history` (which introduced this initially in #1387), and it seems to be working for me. That is, with various themes I've tried, including two-line ones, it doesn't show the prompt-overwriting problem for me.\n",

        "body": "OMZ isn't a web-oriented tool per se, but there are several places where URLs are used in it: reporting pwd to terminal applications, working with `svn` repo URLs, and so on. URL encoding and decoding of strings comes in to play there. This is nontrivial, so it would be nice to have functions for it available in the core library, so plugins and other code can use them. Could be useful for users building their own scripts and working on the command line, too, since a lot of development work is web stuff.\n\nThis PR adds `omz_urlencode()` and `omz_urldecode()` functions to `lib.functions.zsh`. Their implementations are pure native `zsh`, for performance and consistency across platforms. (Well, except for a call to `iconv` when needed for non-UTF-8 locales.) They provide:\n- A pretty full implementation of RFC 2396, handling all the character classes\n- Handling of locale's character set\n- Safe with respect to literal '\\' and '%' in encoded strings\n- Options to encode \"mark\" and \"reserved\" characters a %-escapes\n- Minimal subshell calls, to avoid performance overhead, especially on Windows/Cygwin\n- No external dependencies except `iconv` for non-UTF-8\n\nIf this PR is accepted, then the single-use urlencode and urldecode functions in pending PRs #3582 and #4128 can be changed to use these central implementations. I'm not making that switch part of this PR because I don't want to intertwine them until it's determined which PRs will be accepted.\n\nThere is an existing `urlencode`/`urldecode` implementation in the `urltools` plugin. But that's not suitable for use by core OMZ code or other plugins, because it would introduce core -> plugin or plugin -> plugin dependencies. They don't have options to control encoding of mark or reserved characters. Plus, those implementations rely on a variety of external components, and some of the definitions appear to be incomplete or inconsistent with each other, and don't have locale handling. Having a single native `zsh` implementation would ensure the same behavior on all systems and make things easier to debug.\n\nFixes #2233\n\nUPDATE: These same functions are now included in #3582. If it is merged, this PR is no longer needed.\n",

This was unexpected by some users, who are using non-customized Git repos as project roots. (See #4110, #4070, discussion in #4106, discussion in #3918).\n\nThis PR restores the old behavior of treating any Git repo as a project root, in addition to #3918's use of `.venv` as defining a project root. Combined with #3918, this means that the lowermost Git repo or customized `.venv` project will be treated as the project root.\n\nThere appear to be some other issues in detection of the venv name and activating venvs, but this PR does not address them. (E.g. invalid venv names are silently ignored and result in th previous venv being left activated.) This PR only undoes the loss of git repo functionality from #3918.\n### Implementation\n\nThis uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` instead of `[[ -d $DIR/.git ]]` to detect git repos, because it is more robust. The presence of a `.git` subdir alone doesn't mean it's an actual git repo. (Try it yourself: just `mkdir .git` and see if it works as a repo.) And the `git` executable should be the source of truth about what is a git repo.\n\nDegrades such that if `git` is not installed, then git repos will be silently ignored and not treated as project roots.\n\nIt seems like there would be an inconsistency between walking up the absolute path vs asking `git rev-parse show-toplevel` what the repo root is, in the case where you are inside a repo which has a symlink to a directory outside the repo, and you have cd'ed down through that directory. However, I tested it, and `git rev-parse show-toplevel` works the same way: it considers your absolute path. I'm not sure if this is the intended behavior for `git` wrt symlinks outside a repo, but we are consistent with it.\n\n[Here's a test script](https://gist.github.com/apjanke/275ee69f3749ee157da5) that demonstrates the `--show-toplevel` behavior. On OS X 10.9.5, I get the following, which is consistent with this PR's code. It looks like `git` evaluates symlinks before locating the top of the repo. (I have Homebrew installed, so `/usr/local` is itself a Git repo.)\n\n```\n$ zsh ./test_rev_parse.zsh\n/Users/janke/tmp/a_git_repo/a_dir/link_to_local_bin\nshow-toplevel: /usr/local\n/Users/janke/tmp/a_git_repo/a_dir/under_tmp\nfatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\nshow-toplevel:\n```\n",

This PR wraps whole thing in an anonymous function so the existing `local` statements actually work. \n\nBut that breaks the theme, because a lot of stuff was done with lazy-evaluated `'...'` quotes, which relied on those actually being persistent global variables.

        "body": "PR #3918 introduced a dependency on the command `realpath` to the virtualenvwrapper plugin. This is a problem because `realpath` is not installed on many systems by default. (It's not even available in the main Homebrew tap for OS X.) This caused problems for some users (#4079).\n\nThis PR removes the `realpath` dependency by replacing `realpath` calls with `zsh`'s native `:A` [parameter expansion modifier](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Modifiers), which does the same thing as `realpath`, except portably and with no external dependency. This is also a performance win because it avoids the need to shell out to an external command.\n\nThe original code also called `realpath` at every step of the directory tree it was walking up. This is unnecessary because the first `realpath` or `:A` call resolves intermediate symlinks. This PR removes the extra calls.\n\nUses `$PWD` instead of `$(pwd)`, to avoid an unnecessary shell-out (for performance) and to make the `:A` modifier call a one-liner.\n\nFixes #4079.\nFixes #4030.\nFixes #4073.\nFixes #4052. (I think.)\nCloses #4025, which attempted to fix the issue by checking for the existence of `realpath`. Using `:A` results in simpler, faster code. (Sorry for stepping on your PR, @SandyRogers, but people are asking for a fix for immediate breakage.)\nCloses #4074, which is basically the same thing. (Sorry for stepping on your PR, too, @mail6543210. I didn't see it when I searched for existing fixes.)\nCloses #2376 (Really, #3918 should have auto-closed #2376, but since this follows on #3918's commits, may as well do it here to avoid the extra clerical work.)\n",

I think this is what #3670 is referring to.\n\nFixes #3670\nCloses #3101 (includes the same fix)\n### iTerm issues\n\nIn iTerm, when you open a new tab, the command to `cd` to the directory you launched it from is displayed, but not executed.\n\n![screen shot 2015-06-26 at 2 07 45 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/8371634/2bc14f1e-1ba8-11e5-90d5-33d651d4b11f.png)\n\nThis seems to be because a trailing semicolon in the `write text` argument prevents it from being executed. The `keystroke return` from ce607d3fcb4c730c991563b4c62725cd89ce0ced appears to be an attempt to fix this, but it didn't work, and was just producing an error. (I think because `keystroke` is a verb for System Events, not for iTerm.)\n\nIn my theme, a blue \"\u2718\" at the beginning indicates an error exit status (nonzero `$?`).\n\nThis PR fixes `tab` for iTerm by removing the trailing semicolon from the commands it runs in the new tab.\n### Terminal.app issues\n\n![screen shot 2015-06-26 at 1 50 50 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/8371543/4cc6f37c-1ba7-11e5-83e0-8560cc9cb16f.png)\n\nIn Terminal.app, `tab()` works to create a new tab, but it outputs a useless-seeming \"tab N of window id XXXX\". I'm assuming people don't actually want that output. And `tab` gives an error exit status even when it succeeded. This is because `tab` goes on to test `[[ \"$the_app\" == 'iTerm' ]] && {` after the code for Terminal.app. That `[[ ... ]] && { ... }` syntax leaves `$?` as nonzero when the test fails, and since that was the last statement in the `tab` function, that becomes the exit status of `tab`. This PR fixes that by replacing the `[[ ... ]] && { ... }` syntax with `if [[ ... ]]; then ...` tests, which don't have the `$?` side effects.\n\n`split_tab` and `vsplit_tab` are not supported under Terminal.app. Calling them gives an error exit status, but no error message to indicate why they failed. (And if the user doesn't have an exit status indicator in their prompt, they may not know what happened.) This PR adds explanatory error messages when you call a `split` function from within an unsupported terminal app. Here's what it looks like under this PR.\n\n![screen shot 2015-06-26 at 2 04 29 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/8371586/c3823346-1ba7-11e5-9e6b-0101104570c5.png)\n### Miscellaneous\n\nThe app detection test, which was the same for all the `*tab` functions, is factored out to a function.\n\nThe existing code is discarding error messages from `osascript` to `/dev/null`. Those error messages are meaningful, and might have helped diagnose this. I restored them.\n\nThe `split_tab` and `vsplit_tab` have the unfortunate side effect of bringing all of the iTerm windows to the front. Probably due to the `tell application \"iTerm\" to activate`. This PR does not fix that.\n",

There is no special handling necessary for Mac; that's just a result of users with old fonts misdiagnosing it.\n\nIn 2012, Powerline changed which Unicode code points are used for its special prompt characters, which has resulted in confusion. There are old versions of the Powerline-patched fonts out there that have the glyphs in the old code point slots. This means that whether Powerline looks \"right\" depends on which version of the fonts you have installed, which version of the code points your theme/prompt definition is using, and whether they are consistent.\n\nWe periodically get bug reports or PRs asking to change this character, and they're often because a user has an old version of the Powerline font installed. (#1906, #2869, #2985, #3713, #4001, #4065, #4083) See #3713 for a good long discussion of the issue.\n\nThese bugs are hard to diagnose and discuss because when literal Powerline characters are included in the source code, the appearance _of the source code itself_ depends on which version of the powerline fonts you have installed and which you're using in your editor.\n\nSwitching to using escape sequences in the theme definition source code means that it is unambiguously readable by anybody, regardless of whether they are using Powerline-patched fonts in the editor, and whether they have the new or obsolete version of them.\n\nThis change also adds comments to the source code explaining the situation, and discouraging users from making further PRs for the segment separator character.\n\nI've tested on OS X with current versions of the Powerline fonts.\n\nTesters needed. \n\nAttn: @agnoster \u2013 sorry for being presumptuous and updating your theme, but I think this change will really help some users out and cut down on noise in the bug tracker.

This means that when they're listed in the output of `set` or related commands, only their names are included, and their values are hidden. This is the same mechanism that Zsh's own `colors` function uses to hide the contents of the `$fg` and `$bg` arrays.\n\nWhen the parameters aren't hidden, doing `set` sends junky output to the terminal, since the control sequences are emitted literally, and there may not be a `$reset_color` bracketing them. This makes the output of `set` harder to read, and makes `grep` fussy when searching through it, complaining about it being a binary file. (Doing `| grep -a` works around it, but it's an annoyance to have to remember to do it, and some users may not know about it.)\n\nHere's an example of the ugly `set` output I currently get, and that this PR resolves.\n\n![screen shot 2015-06-08 at 7 06 23 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/8033599/d498a942-0dad-11e5-9b7d-b08a1368a723.png)\n\n![screen shot 2015-06-08 at 7 06 31 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/8033600/d79a0406-0dad-11e5-8c24-afc838daa3f9.png)\n\n```\n$ set | grep terminfo\nBinary file (standard input) matches\n[@ in ~]\n$\n```\n",

(If you have access to the commit message, more than likely you can access the diff of the commit via a multitude of other methods (CLI tools, GUI tools, web interfaces in a much nicer looking format.)\r\n\r\nAm I missing some vital logic behind the reasoning to showing the entire diff in a commit message???\r\n",

For non-Cygwin platforms (e.g., Linux, OS X), this only partially addresses #630 by improving startup error reporting in a platform-independent manner. In theory, that should both improve the readability of related bug reports _and_ enable end users to locally fix this issue themselves.\n## The Problem\n\nThe `oh-my-zsh.sh` startup script currently caches completions as follows:\n\n```\ncompinit -i -d \"${ZSH_COMPDUMP}\"\n```\n\n**That's a problem.** The `-i` option instructs `compinit()` to silently ignore all top-level completion-dependent directories having insecure permissions and/or ownership, typically resulting in an effectively empty `.zcompdump` file [_read:_ on the order of 160B rather than the expected 32KB].

Eliminating the `-i` option to `compinit()` reveals the underlying issue: \n\n```\nzsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.\nIgnore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?\n```\n\n**Ah ha!** Running `compaudit()` yields output resembling:\n\n```\n There are insecure directories:\n /home/Administrator/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/git\n /usr/share/zsh/site-functions\n /usr/share/zsh/5.0.6/functions\n /home/Administrator/.oh-my-zsh/plugins\n /home/Administrator/.oh-my-zsh\n /usr/share/zsh\n /usr/share/zsh/5.0.6\n```\n\nSo basically everything then? **Yup.** Under Cygwin, _all_ top-level `zsh` directories are installed with insecure permissions enabling group writability. This is a [well-known issue](http://blog.en.edaro.net/2014/01/fix-broken-autocompletion-with-zsh-in.html) with [well-known one-liner fixes](http://www.wezm.net/technical/2008/09/zsh-cygwin-and-insecure-directories/).\n\nIn short, there are a number of interlocking issues with `oh-my-zsh.sh`'s completion initialization. Insecure path permissions are hidden rather than listed, preventing sane debugging and issue resolution. Cygwin seemingly _always_ installs `zsh` with insecure path permissions, significantly exacerbating this issue on that platform.\n## The Solution\n\nIf insecure path permissions are detected at `oh-my-zsh` startup:\n- Under all platforms including Cygwin:\n  - Insecure paths are now explicitly listed to the user _before_ completions are initialized.\n  - If the current terminal is interactive, the `-i` option is no longer passed to `compinit()`. This instructs `zsh` to query the user as to whether these paths should be ignored _or_ completions left unitialized. (See the above prompt.)\n- Under Cygwin, if the current terminal is interactive, `oh-my-zsh` now queries the user as to whether these paths should be automatically repaired. Since the core problem is insecure group writability, the solution is to simply disable group writability for all problematic directories with magical one-liner magic. (_It's magical!_)\n\nThus dies another bug in the night.\n",

This allows for specifying where `nvm` is installed so that global installs can be achieved. The plugin now looks for the `NVM_DIR` environment variable that should contain the `nvm` install path. The default value is `~/.nvm` to not break config of people using this plugin.\n",

However, this is still better than the current behavior of `chsh` failing and the install stopping in the middle:\n\n```\n$ curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh\n[...]\nCloning Oh My Zsh...\nCloning into '/home/user/.oh-my-zsh'...\n[...]\nLooking for an existing zsh config...\nUsing the Oh My Zsh template file and adding it to ~/.zshrc\nCopying your current PATH and adding it to the end of ~/.zshrc for you.\nTime to change your default shell to zsh!\nchsh: option requires an argument -- 's'\nUsage: chsh [options] [LOGIN]\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help                    display this help message and exit\n  -s, --shell SHELL             new login shell for the user account\n\n```\n\nHere's a screen show of the new lines:\n\n![screen shot 2015-04-21 at 8 03 40 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100427/7266638/9fe01eea-e861-11e4-90a7-b4a21f8186bf.png)\n",

        "body": "### Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies the theme support code between the `themes` plugin and core `oh-my-zsh` by folding the `themes` plugin in to `lib/themes-and-appearance.zsh` and having `oh-my-zsh.sh` use its functions for the initial theme loading. It adds code for robustness, including the support for unloading themes, debugging the theme loading process, and fixing `local` declarations inside themes.\r\n\r\nFixes #3742.\r\nCloses #3703.\r\nFixes #3704.\r\nFixes #3586.\r\nFixes #3585.\r\nFixes #8889.\r\nCloses #3587.\r\nCloses #3337.\r\nCloses #3739.\r\nCloses #3741.\r\nCloses #3703.\r\nCloses #2962. (\"random\" functionality provided via a keyword arg instead of defined theme.)\r\nCloses #2113. (`$ZSH_THEME=\"\"` will disable theming.)\r\nCloses #4471 (which changes search logic in `theme` plugin; this PR effectively includes that change.)\r\nCloses #4605 (this also removes the `lstheme` `cd` and adds looking in `$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes`\r\n\r\n### What this accomplishes\r\n\r\nBehavior of themes loaded by `oh-my-zsh.sh` during the initialization process and the `theme()` function is now consistent.\r\n\r\nThemes can be cleanly switched during a zsh session. Previously, there was no way to cleanly unload a theme, so loading a new theme using the `themes` plugin could end up with a mix of settings from the new theme and previously loaded themes. This adds a mechanism to \"unload\" a theme by resetting theme-related variables to defaults and removing theme-installed `chpwd`/`preexec`/`precmd` hooks.\r\n\r\nThemes defined in `$ZSH_CUSTOM` are supported everywhere now, so they can be used in initial startup or `theme()` calls, and are included in random theme selection.\r\n\r\nAdds new `theme next` and `theme <n>` calling forms to let you step through the list of all defined themes. Adds new `theme off` command for unloading the theme and reverting to ZSH default values.\r\n\r\nFixes leakage of `local` variables defined inside themes. Previously, they were sourced in the top-level shell namespace, so `local` declarations had no effect.\r\n\r\nAdds \"blacklist\" support to exclude certain themes from being picked by `random` or `next`, as requested in #3704. (Also important for working with the theme debugging code.)\r\n\r\nAdds optional debugging output to the theme loading process so you can evaluate themes for correctness and side effects.\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nFixes the `local` definitions in themes by sourcing the theme definition from inside a function call, to provide a layer of indirection. The additional function call stack frame becomes the context for `local` declarations.\r\n\r\nFixes themes that were relying on not-really-local behavior for parameters declared as `local` inside the theme definitions. Mostly these were of the pattern `local ret_status=\"...\"; SOME_PROMPT='${ret_status}'` and were fixed by moving `${ret_status}` outside the single-quotes or replacing them with double-quotes, so the parameter substitution happens at theme loading time instead of prompt evaluation time.\r\n\r\nFixes the `lstheme()` function to remove the `pwd` side effects, and has all code that wants to get a list of themes call `lstheme` instead of looking through the theme directories themselves. Now everything has a consistent view of what themes are defined. The total ordering of themes is well-defined and stable, so it can be used as a reference for loading themes by index.\r\n\r\nThe `theme next` command uses that `lstheme` ordering to allow you to iterate through the whole list of themes. This is mostly useful for debugging and development work.\r\n\r\nThe non-existent `$ZSH/completions` directory added to `$fpath` by `oh-my-zsh.sh` is created, as a place for the `_theme` completion definition to go. This avoids adding `$ZSH/lib` to `$fpath`.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the code that track hook functions and debugging state do set difference operations on arrays. To be compatible with ZSH 4.x, this is done with a custom `_omz_array_setdiff` function instead of using the `${foo:|bar}` substitution, which is new in ZSH 5.x.\r\n### Possible conflicts\r\n\r\nThe `theme` and `lstheme` functions are now always defined when oh-my-zsh is loaded, instead of just when the `themes` plugin is loaded.\r\n\r\nIf any themes declare parameters as `local` but are actually relying on them behaving as globals, this could break those themes, because `local` parameters really will be local now. (That is a bug in those theme definitions, since they're misusing `local`.) This PR includes fixes to all the themes in the repo that were doing so.\r\n\r\nConflicts with #2401 since the code diverges significantly.\r\n",

This wraps the use of \"local\" variable `$ret_status` in an anonymous function so it's local to just the theme setup, and doesn't leak `$ret_status` in to the global namespace.\n\nTheme definitions are `source`d, and not autoloaded and called as functions, so they do not have their own scope for variable definitions aside from the caller's. Without the anonymous function, the `local ret_status` happens at the top level of the `zsh` session, and so is in the global namespace and still visible after the theme is loaded.\n\n```\n\u279c  ~  zsh -l\n\u279c  ~  echo $ret_status\n%(?:%{%}\u279c :%{%}\u279c %s)\n\u279c  ~\n```\n\nCaused by #3742, which has a longer explanation.\n",

Add code to detect homebrew and check its cask completion location, too.\n\nI've tested on OS X 10.9, and it works for me for regular Cask, Homebrew Cask, and having both installed. For the regular Cask, I had to grab version 0.7.2 instead of the head of master, because they're recently removed the zsh completions from the main Cask project. To install non-homebrew Cask version 0.7.2 for testing, do this:\n\n```\ncd\ngit clone https://github.com/cask/cask.git .cask\ncd .cask\ngit checkout tags/v0.7.1\nexport PATH=\"~/.cask/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nAnd then do `zsh -l` from that session. Or add that PATH statement in your `~/.zshrc` so that all new sessions pick it up.\n",

It shouldn't change the directory.\n\n```\n[@ in ~]\n~ \u00bb pwd\n/Users/janke\n~ \u00bb lstheme > /dev/null\n.oh-my-zsh/themes [master] \u00bb pwd\n/Users/janke/.oh-my-zsh/themes\n.oh-my-zsh/themes [master] \u00bb\n```\n### Custom theme locations\n\nIt seems like the dir structure of $ZSH_CUSTOM should mirror the directory structure of the main oh-my-zsh directory. Theme() looks under the themes/ subdir of the main dir, but the root dir under $ZSH_CUSTOM. This is also inconsistent with `oh-my-zsh.sh`, which looks in both `/` and `themes/` under $ZSH_CUSTOM.\n\nReally, most of the theme plugin implementation is duplicated by the theme loading section in the `oh-my-zsh.zsh` script. The theme plugin should probably be moved in to `lib/theme-and-appearance.zsh` and `oh-my-zsh.zsh` should call it.\n",

This I did because, as it was before, commands in the else statement weren't all that were available to run. Now, all commands will be shown instead (deprecates #2143).\n**If no one agrees with this change I can get rid of it**.\n\nFix #2000, fix #2049, fix #3375.\nClose #2143.\nClose #3514, close #3555.\n",

        "body": "The current uninstall script attempts to `chsh -s /bin/bash` to change the default login shell for the user back to `bash`.  But `chsh -s /bin/bash` requires user login, and the script cannot deal with login failure or any disruption to the command.  The main change, in general terms, is to check the exit code of `chsh -s /bin/bash` and to prompt the user more appropriately in case of success or failure of the login.  A minor change is to remove the command `source /etc/profile`.  This is because, as [explained here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/3447), according to the [OS X bash man page](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bash.1.html) `/etc/profile` is sourced first after `bash` is invoked as an interactive login shell (or a non-interactive login shell with the `--login` option).  So having done `chsh -s /bin/bash` the user would be expected to open either a new window from their terminal app or close and reopen their terminal app, which will start an interactive login `bash` shell that will source `/etc/profile` first.  Thus this is unnecessary in the uninstall script.\n\nIn the case of success `chsh -s /bin/bash` will reset the `UserShell` attribute of the user\u2019s record in the OS X Directory Services database for their local domain node `.` back to `/bin/bash`, but this change is not immediately reflected in the working shell window (in which the uninstall script was executed).  So the change here specifically involves asking the user whether they would like to do this, and dealing with the two different possibilities.\n\nThese changes are self-explanatory, but could be improved even further - for example, an assumption is made that the user wants to default back to `/bin/bash` but perhaps they do not, or perhaps they do not care because they have specified a specific shell type and path in their terminal app, or they do not wish to default to `bash` but another one of the accepted shells in `/etc/shells`.  For the moment thought these changes should make the uninstallation process less painful and the script easier to maintain and debug.\n\nNote: the default login shell for a local domain user, from the point of OS X, is determined not by environment variables like `SHELL` or the shell preferences in Terminal.app but the value of the `UserShell` attribute of the user's record in the OS X Directory Services database for the their local domain node `.`.  Moreover executing `chsh -s <shell path>` in the active shell window will in fact change this attribute directly but the change will not be visible immediately unless a new shell window is opened or the session restarted or with a command like `exec su - $USER`.\n",

But, if that's the case, then `pushd -q +1` doesn't work correctly. \n\nTo that end I standardised that option since it seems to change between different zsh setups. You can read more in the [`PUSHD_MINUS` section of the `zshoptions` manpage](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Options.html#index-PUSHDMINUS).\n\nI also removed the evals and cleaned up the plugin a little bit. \n#### RFC (Request For Comments)\n##### 1. Fast switch\n\nI added in commit d63120501ed924b801774359fb3e8be902cbd0e5 the hability to switch between directories and redraw the prompt without using a new line to run the `pushd` command. \nHere are a couple of screencasts showcasing the difference:\n- [Current switch (**old** version)](https://asciinema.org/a/15264): \n  ![dircycle slow-switch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1441704/5599081/3c0a486e-92c1-11e4-9567-0d416d6cc351.gif)\n- [Fast switch (**new** version)](https://asciinema.org/a/15265): \n  ![dircycle fast-switch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1441704/5599077/285ff340-92c1-11e4-9d95-0dd070556a74.gif)\n\n**Please comment what you think about this new behavior**.\n##### 2. Left/right switch direction\n\nFinally the chosen behavior for left/right is (see https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3413#issuecomment-67987390): \n- `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`LEFT`: moves to last visited directory\n- `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`RIGHT`: moves to next visited directory\n\nthe previous behavior seemed a little odd an unintuitive to me:\n- `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`LEFT`: moves to directory on the left as appears in `dirs` output\n- `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`RIGHT`: moves to directory on the right\n\n**Please comment which direction you think is better**.\n\n---\n\nClose #1566\nClose #2134\nClose #2101\nClose #2474\n",

The commit used is the one in #3105, provided by @gugu, for being the first to submit the fix.\n- Fixing a misspelling in the `_gitignoreio_get_command_list` function. Fix provided by @ashaindlin in #3225.\n- Using the follow-redirects flag (`-L`) in case the URL changes again. Fix provided by @wooparadog in #3203.\n- Using the silent flag in `gi()` too, as was asked by @yachi in https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3105#issuecomment-58313493. \n\nAll in all, the plugin now uses curl in `follow-redirects` and `silent` mode **in both calls**. This should satisfy all submitted user requests, as well as prevent the need to update it in the future.\n\nThank you all involved.\n\nClose #3105.\nClose #3203.\nClose #3225.\n\nClose #3231.\nClose #3242.\n",

This breaks the `gwip` alias in [the current `git` plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/a869ec9bc848a011a3068fbaed52b4cbd04681aa/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh). See #2692 and #2713.\n\nThe bug was introduced by a869ec9bc848a011a3068fbaed52b4cbd04681aa. The original intention was to take care of the possibility that `git ls-files --deleted -z` would not send anything in the pipe. However, the author @bdubertret failed to see that, in that case, only the GNU flavor of `xarg` fails.\n\nThis is because the GNU flavor does not follow the `xargs` standard, and fails on empty input instead of returning 0 silently: it requires the `-r` flag in order to adopt the standard behavior. Apparently, all BSD flavors abide by the standard, and thus need not the `-r` flag; some of them (_eg_ FreeBSD) still silently support the flag for the sake of compatibility, but others (_eg_ Mac OSX) do not and fail in case they see it. Hence this PR.\n",

(read first)\n\nIt's basically a big clean up, that shouldn't really break anything - it works almost completely the same, just tidier.\n- Wraps each step up in an own function, which makes the code more self documenting.\n- Refactored out all duplication\n  - Checking twice for plugins erased. The plugin names are expanded to their full plugin path now just once, whether it resides in the custom or the default directory. They are stuffed in a variable which is reused (check comment starting on line 8).\n  - Using variables instead of writing the paths out 4 times on 4 lines.\n  - Sourcing of files wrapped in a function.\n- Deletes the addition of $ZSH/functions and $ZSH/completions to fpath - those two directories do no exist (any more?)\n- Fix of #2342 is applied.\n\nBreaking changes:\n- Plugins are only changed against the *.plugin.zsh naming convention, the variant with underscore is not checked. If that breaks plugins shipped with oh-my-zsh, I will change their names.\n- Custom themes have to be in a themes folder and not at the top level of the custom dir - as it would be documented in the wiki text I wrote.\n- I don't think both deprecated options are widely used anyway, but I could be wrong.\n\nProposal:\n- Adding a changelog file, that is displayed in upgrade.sh. It might not have to all complete at all times, but in case any relevant changes are merged in, this could be a good place to inform people about was might affect them after upgrading.\n\nProbably controversial:\n- The file is mildly converted to zsh syntax. I think it's safe to assume that people will use zsh when they source this file :). Can be reverted back in a single step, however, I placed a symbolic link to avoid breaking backward compatibility. People sourcing oh-my-zsh.sh in their .zshrc will be redirected to the new oh-my-zsh.zsh file.\n\nA question left:\n- Could someone check the message of commit 7e79ed795f9d392de460efc87d1a787e2400eee7? It's regarding adding the plugin paths to fpath. The refactor does now exactly as the former script, but I am actually not sure that it's needed. Can someone explain this?\n\nIf people want to dig in further how oh-my-zsh works, this will be the file they first look at - it's easier to get an overview this way IMO.\n\nCurious to hear your opinions.\n\nUpdate: Also revampled lib/git.zsh - see #2386.\n",

        "body": "### Update\n\nFixes most of the issues that arise when themes use a *_prompt_info function that a user does not want.\nThere's a long list of problems people encounter, just taking one example: The af-magic theme implements virtualenv_prompt info to it's prompt - when people don't use the virtualenv plugin they receive a command_not_found error.\nTheme creators now use conditional clauses to determine whether the function is available or not. Even worse, sometimes people just add the plugin even if they don't need it, just to get rid of the error message.\n\nthe prompt_info_functions file implements dummy functions for all *_prompt_info functions that can be found in the plugins section.These dummies just return with an exit status of 1 (that is: false). Because plugins are loaded after lib functions, users that add a plugin to their configuration will have the dummy implementation overridden by something that actually returns something.\n\nNew plugin creators are encouraged to add their *_prompt_info function to the list of dummy implementations by a doc string in the file's header.\n\nThis adds a lot to the 'just works' approach of oh-my-zsh as theme creators don't have to care if a *_prompt_info is actually available to them or not. It will just work out of the box without error messages. Check the following code piece to see a real example.\n\n``` bash\n# recent fix implemented by @andyfleming in #2330 \nif type \"virtualenv_prompt_info\" > /dev/null\nthen\n  RPROMPT='$(virtualenv_prompt_info)$my_gray%n@%m%{$reset_color%}%'\nelse\n  RPROMPT='$my_gray%n@%m%{$reset_color%}%'\nfi\n\n# after this pull request everything can stay as is\nRPROMPT='$(virtualenv_prompt_info)$my_gray%n@%m%{$reset_color%}%'\n\n# works for virtualenv users like the true path in the above conditional \n# and for others like the false path.\n```\n\nAlso implements a fix for the erroneous RPROMPT in af-magic. This is for convenience reasons, the fix is around in several other pull requests.\n\nFixes #2330, fixes #2328, fixes #2297, fixes #2319, fixes #2393, fixes #2389 and probably many others from the past and future.\n# \n\nrvm_prompt_info fix comes into play when ZSH_THEME_RVM_PROMPT_OPTIONS actually contains a string value.\n\nLet's say we have this:\n\n``` bash\nZSH_THEME_RVM_PROMPT_OPTIONS='i v'\nrvm_prompt=$($HOME/.rvm/bin/rvm-prompt ${ZSH_THEME_RVM_PROMPT_OPTIONS} 2>/dev/null)\necho $rvm_prompt # => i v\n```\n\nZSH doesn't do string splitting by default, that's why such a weird output is displayed.\nIn an earlier version this PR solved this through an eval call, but that's overkill - sorry for the misunderstanding. Simply enabling word-splitting does the trick. It's possible now to pass in string values (like 'i v s') and arrays (like (i v s)).\n\nAlso changes the return value in case rvm is not found - now returns 1 (negative exit code). This makes OR sequences possible like\n\n``` bash\necho $(rvm_prompt_info || rbenv_prompt_info) \n```\n\nwhich otherwise return with an empty string, because rvm_prompt_info is never false.\nSame goes for the implementation of rbenv_prompt_info in case you want to try it the other way around.\nAlso adds chruby_prompt_info which mirrors the functionality of rbenv_prompt_info.\n\nAll this allows us to easily implement a function ruby_prompt_info\n\n``` bash\nfunction ruby_prompt_info() {\n  echo $(rvm_prompt_info || rbenv_prompt_info || chruby_prompt_info)\n}\n```\n\nwhich can be used to clean up themes and add support for all ruby version management systems at once.\n",

The problem is documented in this issue I filed (while mistakenly believing the problem to lie with virtualenvwrapper):\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper/issue/216/lsvirtualenv-and-workon-output-broken-in\n\nThe solution I'm proposing here is to use the precmd hook instead of chpwd. This resolves the actual issue, which is that a bunch of text (wrapped in control characters) was spewed to STDOUT upon returning from a subshell in which the working directory was changed.  (In theory, other 3rd party applications might also be affected.)\n\nIt does, of course, mean that the function to update the proxy icon will be executed a great deal more frequently, though that shouldn't be an issue on a modern system.\n",

This works just fine, and in fact some programs (such as JetBrains' RubyMine) only support rbenv with Rubies installed in `~/.rbenv`, so it's important to leave it there when possible.\n\nThis PR leaves existing RBENV_ROOT values intact and causes Homebrew-installed rbenv's to default to the same setting that Homebrew would (`~/.rbenv`).\n",

Thus, hub is executed, which is slower than git and isn't needed for what this file does (branch name indicator, dirty working tree indicator etc.).\n\nComparison between the two:\n\n$ time command git version\ngit version 1.7.10.4\ncommand git version  0.00s user 0.00s system 70% cpu 0.006 total\n\n$ time hub version\ngit version 1.7.10.4\nhub version 1.10.6\nhub version  0.46s user 0.06s system 94% cpu 0.549 total\n",

This means that instead of getting something potentially less useful, like `HEAD~17` you can get something like `remotes/origin/v1.2.3`.\n\nThe rebaase was pretty clean, so I am confident this is working as well as before.  I would still really love to see this in upstream, so I can stop rebasing it every few months! :)  Thanks!\n",

I couldn't find a theme that had the set of features I wanted, so I made my own.\n\nIt has: git branch, git status, etc., as well as right-aligned history number, time executed, and return code.

Not setting that variable leaves it as it behaved before.\nThe plugin attempts to get the path to the cookbooks from the knife.rb conf file.  However, the knife.rb conf allows ruby in the cookbook_path definition (in my case cookbook_path is \"#{current_dir}/../cookbooks\"). Since zsh is not using ruby to parse the conf file, it fails to expand variables like #{current_dir}.  Rather than try and use ruby to interpret knife.rb (which is scary), I added an override for the cookbook directory.  Set KNIFE_COOKBOOK_PATH in your .zshrc to skip examining knife.rb for the cookbook_path.\n",

Autoquit: close the terminal session when tmux exits. By default this is set to the value of Autostart.\n4. FixTerm: When running tmux, the variable `$TERM` is supposed to be set to `screen` or one of its derivatives. Unfortunately, tmux has now way to say \"if the host terminal supports 256 colors, make TERM `screen-256color`, else make TERM `screen`. Setting this option enables that behavior. Enabled by default.\n\nIf the user specifies any arguments for tmux then the command is just executed as the typed it without any modification.\n",

It uses the `bower help` command to achieve this, not a burned-in list of commands.\nIt also provides completition for bower install, uses the output of bower search. It takes a few seconds for the first time (in the session), but then the output of `bower search` is cached, so things then speed up a lot.\n### Example\n\n```\n# to install jquery for example\nbi jq<TAB>\n```\n",

If they happen to have the same name as scripts in $ZSH/lib, then they are sourced instead (i.e. custom files now override oh-my-zsh settings). I decided to do this so that I can have direct control over what oh-my-zsh does to my shell without modifying your default script files. If this is not a functionality you are looking for, feel free to ignore the pull request.\n\nSecondly, custom plugins now go directly into $ZSH/custom/<myplugin> directory instead of $ZSH/custom/plugins/<myplugin>. The script has no functionality to source anything in any other $ZSH/custom subfolders, so why have the plugins subfolder anyway?\n",

The plugin assumes autoenv is installed under ~/.autoenv a.k.a autoenv is git checked-out to .autoenv. I'm open to any suggestions about that.\n\nThe use_env function in the plugin is used to auto-activate virtualenv and needs virtualenvwrapper. The code is taken from https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv/wiki/Cookbook\n\nFor the autoenv users, I think this plugin would help much. I'd be pleased if you merge the code into master branch. I'd also appreciate any comments on how to improve the code.\n\nPeace!\n\n-Serdar\n",

The systems I'm working on are running git `1.6.0.4` and `1.6.3.3`, so I gated the old-style status checking to `<1.6.4`.  I couldn't find documentation anywhere of when the `--short` format was first supported, so that version comparison can and should be changed if someone knows better.  Also, I'm not a shell scripting maven, so it's possible my code is horribly unconventional or wrong, and I'd appreciate feedback on that.  Thanks.\n",

Although the _virtualenv_ ends up activated, this consumes processing and leaves the user waiting (annoyed) for a while until the error occurs.\n### Scenario and Solution\n\nThe `workon_cwd` function already makes some checks before activating a _virtualenv_, then - if it is successfully done - it sets the environment variable `CD_VIRTUAL_ENV`, which is used internally by the plugin. \n\nThe solution found was to add another verification using the environment variable, in order to check if the _virtualenv_ is being set, and then, if not so, set the variable just before calling `workon`, making sure to unset it if something goes wrong.\n",

While one could of course argue that that's the fault of those programs, `less` fortunately offers a convenient way to store default options (see its man page):\n\n> Options are also taken from the environment variable \"LESS\".\n\nThis of course also sets the option when `less` is called directly and not through `$PAGER`, what I think is a sensible thing as well. Note additionally that it's consistent with the way `$GREP_OPTIONS` options are set.\n",

The one thing that I'd consider to be a real downside is that for the theme to work properly, a user must be using a Powerline-patched font. While these are readily available, and documented in the theme, the odds of a user simply changing their ZSH_THEME to \"agnoster\" and then being frustrated when it doesn't render properly could be considered too high.\n\nAnyway, otherwise I think it's a quite delightful theme ;-). I'd prefer for there to be a cleaner way to browse and discover themes, and see their prerequisites clearly advertised.\n\nIt might be best to simply point people at the gist (https://gist.github.com/3712874), where the prereq is a bit clearer. Obviously it means more work to install, but since the user would need to install a font anyway, I don't think that's too great a burden. Probably better for you, at any rate, to have fewer people coming and complaining when the prompt doesn't render correctly! I know what a pain that can be.\n\nBut if you decide you just got to have it, you're very welcome to merge, as you see fit.\n\nCheers, and thanks for OMZ!\n",

The way \"oh-my-zsh\" deals with customizations has created an explosion of pull requests some of which are probably too narrow to be in the main repo. This is a maintenance burden. Imo, only generic functionality should be added to this repo - not personal adjustments and tweaks.\n\n**One solution**\n\nAllow users to make tweaks outside of the repo.  This will deincentivize fork/pulls for personal changes.\n\nIn this pull I added the concept of 'local customizations'. Instead of adding tweaks to `~/.oh-my-zsh` you can instead add them to `~/.zsh`. You can then separately track this folder in a personal repo. I added mine to my dotfiles repo, for example.\n\nThis is backward compatible with the `/custom` folder, but imo we should phase that idea out. Also, adjustments in the `~/.zsh` folder have precedence over those in `/custom`.\n",

The git repo part of the theme is taken from the existing kolo oh-my-zsh theme, with some minor alterations. I've included fairly thorough comments in the file.\n\nI have also removed the calls to compinit in the extract and bundler plugins, which, for me at least, results in a much improved startup time, going from a life-sapping 3 seconds average to a much snappier, happy-making 0.2 seconds average. I don't use those plugins on a daily basis, but have tested my changes and believe they don't break anything. compinit only needs to be called once, I think, and I believe the oh-my-zsh.sh script does that in the correct place to pull in all compdefs declared during inclusion of themes and plugins.\n\nThanks for oh-my-zsh - it's got me interested in learning more about this excellent shell.\n",

And it will even work if the upstream is not called 'origin'.\n",

Right now, the tm command must be passed a directory, and it attempts to cd into the directory and open it in TextMate. However, the order of operations is wrong, so it doesn't actually work (at least not very well).\n\nI've improved the tm command to:\n- Open the current directory in TextMate when it's passed no arguments; so typing tm by itself will just open up TextMate with all of the files in the current directory in the project drawer\n- Open a single file when passed a filename; so typing \"tm ~/.zshrc\" will open your .zshrc in TextMate\n- Open a directory in TextMate and cd in to it when passed a directory - the original intention of the command\n\nHope this helps everyone else as much as it's helped my workflow!\n",

Now that `require_tool' script has been added, I guess it is time to come before you with this new one.\n\nHere is a copy/paste of `emacs.plugin.zsh' header:\n\nEmacs 23 daemon capability is a killing feature. One emacs process handles all your frames whether you use a frame opened in a terminal via a ssh connection or X frames opened on the same host.\n\nBenefits are multiple\n- You don't have the cost of starting Emacs all the time anymore\n- Opening a file is as fast as Emacs does not have anything else to do.\n- You can share opened buffered across opened frames.\n- Configuration changes made at runtime are applied to all frames.\n\nIt provides aliases, helper functions, and set EDITOR environment variable.\n\nBest regards and thank you again for this repo.\n",

        "body": "This fixes the problem raised by issue #387, wherein activating the vi-mode plugin causes history lines to be overwritten if PROMPT contains multiple lines. The vi-mode plugin currently sets both `zle-line-init` and `zle-keymap-select` as triggers for `zle reset-prompt`, causing the prompt to be drawn twice each time the user is prompted for a command. In normal circumstances, this is not an issue, as the second redraws over the first. But when the prompt contains newline characters, this seems to mess up zsh's internal knowledge of how many lines upward it should move before attempting the next `zle reset-prompt`, overwriting the last N lines of the previous command's output, where N is the number of newlines in the prompt. After much fiddling, I figured out that the definition of `zle-line-init` is actually unnecessary, and simply removing it fixes the bug.\n\nNote that for this to work correctly, your `PROMPT` definition should not use any special escaping for newlines. If the newline characters are surrounded by `%{` and `%}`, you will see additional lines added when entering and leaving vi insert mode. So don't do that.\n\n-- Riley\n",

I talked a bit about [my thoughts on the matter on my blog](http://blog.patshead.com/2011/05/my-take-on-the-go-command.html).\n\nThe \"go\" command is a sort of \"do what I mean\" command.  It tries to do things with the argument in this order:\n1. open files that look like text in $EDITOR\n2. if not a text file, try xdg-open\n3. if existing directory, change to it\n4. if no argument, act like `cd` with no argument\n5. if autojump's `j` function is defined, use it\n6. give up\n\nIt feels pretty handy for me so far, but I am having a horrible time unlearning my cd/emacs/j/etc muscle memory.\n\nPat\n",

        "body": "This plugin implements vi-mode command line editation:\n- it sets vi-mode so hitting &lt;esc&gt; switches to _normal_ mode, where hjkl and friends work\n- it setups the prompt, so that anytime you switch to _normal_ mode a visual indicator appears, and if you switch back to _insert_ mode, the indicator dissapears. Technically, this is implemented as a prompt reset.\n\nThe visual indicator is customizable from a theme by setting a `MODE_INDICATOR` variable. Additionally, this plugin provides `vi_mode_prompt_info()` function, which should be used from PROMPT variables. I like this indicator placed on the right side of the prompt, so if the plugin detects that the right prompt is not set, it sets the default one. I used this approach in favor of modifying all existing themes to support vi-mode prompt.\n\nThis screenshot shows the default _normal_ mode indicator.\n![vi-mode in action](http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/96/vimode.png)\n",

        "body": "This is a followup to issue #34.\nThe problem is that cd autocompletion list contains weird entries, that exist beyond current working directory. For example, when I type cd d&lt;tab&gt;, it expands to a list of local directories starting with d, plus dbus and daemon.\n\nThis is actually a feature, that is called named directories. Named directory is a variable, which value starts with '/'. It is used to define aliases for directories. E.g.\n    projects='/home/kremso/projects'\nprojects is now a named directory and can be cd'ed to from anywhere using the alias. \n    cd projects\nWhat happens in the background is that zsh creates a variable called ~projects and by default, cd zstyle is configured to autocomplete it. If you type cd ~&lt;tab&gt; you will see a list of all defined named directories.\n\nIssue #34 was closed with a fix: `unset config_file`, but this is wrong. That line just unsets `config_file` named directory definition, but all other are left intact and are still being autocompleted. The real solution is to configure cd zstyle to not autocomplete from named directories and user directories (similar feature). This is what my changes do,\n",
