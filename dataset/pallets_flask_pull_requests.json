Here is an example of the permissions in one of the workflow runs:\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/actions/runs/3166686271/jobs/5156565079#step:1:19\n\nAfter this change, the scopes will be reduced to the minimum needed for the following workflows:\n\n- lock.yaml\n- tests.yaml\n\n\n### Motivation and Context\n\n- This is a security best practice, so if the GITHUB_TOKEN is compromised due to a vulnerability or compromised Action, the damage will be reduced.\n- [GitHub recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token) defining minimum GITHUB_TOKEN permissions.\n- The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) also treats not setting token permissions as a high-risk issue. This change will help increase the Scorecard score for this repository.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ashish Kurmi <akurmi@stepsecurity.io>",

        "body": "This adds the ability to fully customize the JSON implementation used by a Flask application. Using a different JSON implementation can greatly speed up API applications that need to work with JSON in most requests.\r\n\r\n`app.json` is an instance of `Flask.json_provider_class`. `flask.json.provider.JSONProvider` is the base class that defines `dumps`, `dump`, `loads`, `load`, and `response` methods, of which only `dumps` and `loads` need to be implemented.  For example, here's a provider for [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask.json.provider import JSONProvider\r\nimport orjson\r\n\r\nclass OrJSONProvider(JSONProvider):\r\n    def dumps(self, obj, *, option=None, **kwargs):\r\n        if option is None:\r\n            option = orjson.OPT_APPEND_NEWLINE | orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC\r\n        \r\n        return orjson.dumps(obj, option=option).decode()\r\n\r\n    def loads(self, s, **kwargs):\r\n        return orjson.loads(s)\r\n\r\n# assign to an app instance\r\napp.json = OrJSONProvider(app)\r\n\r\n# or assign in a subclass\r\nclass MyFlask(Flask):\r\n    json_provider_class = OrJSONProvider\r\n\r\napp = MyFlask(__name__)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe methods in `flask.json` call the methods on `app.json` if an app context is active, or fall back to the `json` library. `jsonify` calls `app.json.response`. The `|tojson` filter uses `app.json.dumps`. `Request.json` uses `app.json.loads` and `Response.json` uses `app.json.dumps`; the test client uses these as well.\r\n\r\nCustomizing `json_encoder` or `json_decoder` on an app or blueprint, and the `JSONEncoder` and `JSONDecoder` classes, are deprecated. This was not an effective way to use other libraries. Customizing per blueprint was requested by an API extension that is no longer maintained and didn't appear to use the feature. It's not clear how it would work with the new provider interface and added overhead to every request. Instead, API frameworks should be using a dedicated object serialization library, then taking advantage of a fast JSON serializer at the application level.\r\n\r\nThe `DefaultJSONProvider` is the existing implementation using the built-in `json` library. The `app.config` keys `JSON_AS_ASCII`, `JSON_SORT_KEYS`, `JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`, and `JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` are deprecated and have moved to attributes on the default provider. Other providers are not required to support these options.",

Maybe we can rethink about this feature? I propose this because the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- List as JSON response is a common use case for Web APIs. We support returning dict as JSON, but not list. This makes people feel inconsistent (#4533, #4659).\r\n- With #2737, we only treat tuple as a valid shortcut for return values, so there will be no program conflicts to allow returning list (we also throw an error for list return value currently).\r\n- In terms of semantics, there is no concept of \"tuple\" in JSON. Although list and tuple are both sequences in Python, there are differences in syntax and meaning. We can add docs to address the different meaning of list and tuple in return values.\r\n- In terms of visuals, most people will not mix `[1, 2, 3]` and `(1, 2, 3)`, and people usually return tuple items without the bracket in the view function.\r\n\r\nIf this change is acceptable, I will update the docs and changelog.\r\n\r\nSorry for break the \"zero status\". :P\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add tests that demonstrate the correct behavior of the change.

However, one of `g.user['id']` and `post['author_id']` was a string and the other was an integer. This caused the equality comparison to fail in every case.\r\n\r\nNow, a Jinja filter is used to cast each of the operands to the same type prior to the equality comparison being evaluated. \r\n\r\nThis ensures that the \"Edit\" link/button now shows up when appropriate.\r\n\r\n- fixes #4587 \r\n\r\nThis PR only touches the docs, so removing the checklist as indicated by the comment.\r\n",

These functions had an\n  extended deprecation due to usage, however the next version of\n  ``cryptography`` will drop support. Users should migrate to ``sign`` and\n  ``verify``.\n* The entire :doc:`/x509/index` layer is now written in Rust. This allows\n  alternate asymmetric key implementations that can support cloud key\n  management services or hardware security modules provided they implement\n  the necessary interface (for example:\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey`).\n* :ref:`Deprecated the backend argument&lt;faq-missing-backend&gt;` for all\n  functions.\n* Added support for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESOCB3`.\n* Added support for iterating over arbitrary request\n  :attr:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest.attributes`.\n* Deprecated the ``get_attribute_for_oid`` method on\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest` in favor of\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Attributes.get_attribute_for_oid` on the new\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.Attributes` object.\n* Fixed handling of PEM files to allow loading when certificate and key are\n  in the same file.\n* Fixed parsing of :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificatePolicies` extensions\n  containing legacy ``BMPString`` values in their ``explicitText``.\n* Allow parsing of negative serial numbers in certificates. Negative serial\n  numbers are prohibited by :rfc:`5280` so a deprecation warning will be\n  raised whenever they are encountered. A future version of ``cryptography``\n  will drop support for parsing them.\n* Added support for parsing PKCS12 files with friendly names for all\n  certificates with\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs12.load_pkcs12`,\n  which will return an object of type\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs12.PKCS12KeyAndCertificates`.\n* :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Name.rfc4514_string` and related methods now have\n  an optional ``attr_name_overrides`` parameter to supply custom OID to name\n  mappings, which can be used to match vendor-specific extensions.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Reverted the nonstandard formatting of\n  email address fields as ``E`` in\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Name.rfc4514_string` methods from version 35.0.\n<p>The previous behavior can be restored with:\n<code>name.rfc4514_string({NameOID.EMAIL_ADDRESS: &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;})</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x25519.X25519PublicKey</code>\nand\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x448.X448PublicKey</code> to\nbe used as public keys when parsing certificates or creating them with\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

I chose this module as a replacement to the use of `os.urandom` as currently the pallets team is responsible for tracking the security of the keys, or is offloading it to their users. By using the secrets module, the Python team is responsible and watching this to determine the risk factor associated with the length of the key, as described on https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#how-many-bytes-should-tokens-use\r\n\r\nAs such, I think this would simplify future maintenance, increase the likelihood of detection should the risk of a specific length key change, and leverages SystemRandom to ensure the strongest secret generator on the system is used.",

This will\n  result in us incrementing the major version more frequently, but does not\n  change our existing backwards compatibility policy.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** The X.509 certificate parser no longer allows\n  negative serial numbers. :rfc:`5280` has always prohibited these.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Invalid ASN.1 found during :doc:`/x509/index`\n  parsing will raise an error on initial parse rather than when the invalid\n  field is accessed.\n* Rust is now required for building ``cryptography``, the\n  ``CRYPTOGRAPHY_DONT_BUILD_RUST`` environment variable is no longer\n  respected.\n* Parsers for :doc:`/x509/index` no longer use OpenSSL and have been\n  rewritten in Rust. This should be backwards compatible (modulo the items\n  listed above) and improve both security and performance.\n* Added support for OpenSSL 3.0.0 as a compilation target.\n* Added support for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.SM3` and\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.SM4`,\n  when using OpenSSL 1.1.1. These algorithms are provided for compatibility\n  in regions where they may be required, and are not generally recommended.\n* We now ship ``manylinux_2_24`` and ``musllinux_1_1`` wheels, in addition to\n  our ``manylinux2010`` and ``manylinux2014`` wheels. Users on distributions\n  like Alpine Linux should ensure they upgrade to the latest ``pip`` to\n  correctly receive wheels.\n* Added ``rfc4514_attribute_name`` attribute to :attr:`x509.NameAttribute\n  &lt;cryptography.x509.NameAttribute.rfc4514_attribute_name&gt;`.\n* Added :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.kbkdf.KBKDFCMAC`.\n<p>.. _v3-4-8:\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/c7fbef767a94ee1569ae0630006fdb144d6a4e8d\"><code>c7fbef7</code></a> bump for 35.0 release (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6333\">#6333</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/82d3f2bdc5500826bfb6a75958ff286af29b8331\"><code>82d3f2b</code></a> update release.py (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6332\">#6332</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/00c54b581d3475ca13383669e5e4df697c96ce09\"><code>00c54b5</code></a> docs: shift image to latest 20.04 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6331\">#6331</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/cb73c72d63b161be34d6df73a6683006dc91cf3b\"><code>cb73c72</code></a> Bump smallvec from 1.6.1 to 1.7.0 in /src/rust (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6329\">#6329</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/90a564e54bfc807b1a8a1fd5696f3489f7ccc980\"><code>90a564e</code></a> build our wheels from tag so we can upload sdist last (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6328\">#6328</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/cf9e57685917b189a3fb5c7e5ea65619363ecfd8\"><code>cf9e576</code></a> fix changelog to remove inaccurate statement (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6327\">#6327</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/329a795446785fde7e44092c0728ec3820e0574b\"><code>329a795</code></a> Improve changelog for cryptography.x509 changes (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6326\">#6326</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/0f2c416e4598877c779cd7a370d9e06d616b562f\"><code>0f2c416</code></a> add CRL pyopenssl fallback (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6325\">#6325</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/57e5176f4d736d84bcc0c32ae303fe7db9f82078\"><code>57e5176</code></a> remove unneeded bindings (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6324\">#6324</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/baa6ff14e3353403008293c3a27cee8b00160282\"><code>baa6ff1</code></a> Bump dessant/lock-threads from 2.1.2 to 3 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6323\">#6323</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/compare/3.4.8...35.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=cryptography&package-manager=pip&previous-version=3.4.8&new-version=35.0.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

For this to work correctly, you must call a greenlet API\nlike <code>getcurrent()</code> before the thread owning the greenlet exits:\nthis is a long-standing limitation that can also lead to the leak of\na thread's main greenlet if not called; we hope to lift this\nlimitation.

When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.\n\n\nYou have configured automerging on this repository. There is no automerging support in GitHub-native Dependabot, so these settings will not be added to the new config file. Several 3rd-party GitHub Actions and bots can replicate the automerge feature.\n\nYour account was configured to allow an unlimited number of open pull requests.

Previously it would result in a Unicode string instead of a native string. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/218\">issue 218</a>.</li>\n<li>Move continuous integration from Travis CI to Github Actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>1.0a1 (2020-11-20)</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the ability to set a greenlet's PEP 567 contextvars context directly, by assigning to the greenlet's <code>gr_context</code> attribute. This restores support for some patterns of using greenlets atop an async environment that became more challenging in 0.4.17. Thanks to Joshua Oreman, Mike bayer, and Fantix King, among others. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/198/\">PR 198</a>.</li>\n<li>The repr of greenlet objects now includes extra information about its state. This is purely informative and the details are subject to change. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/215\">issue 215</a>.</li>\n<li>The <code>greenlet</code> module is now a package. There are no API changes, so all existing imports, including from C code, should continue to work.</li>\n<li>(C API) The undocumented <code>GREENLET_VERSION</code> macro that defined a string giving the greenlet version is now deprecated and will not be updated.</li>\n<li>(Documentation) Publish the change log to <a href=\"https://greenlet.readthedocs.io\">https://greenlet.readthedocs.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop support for Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4. The project metadata now includes the <code>python_requires</code> data to help installation tools understand supported versions.</li>\n<li>Add partial support for AIX ppc64 and IBM i. Thanks to Jesse Gorzinski and Kevin Adler. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/pull/197\">PR 197</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Packaging Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Require setuptools to build from source.</li>\n<li>Stop asking setuptools to build both .tar.gz and .zip sdists. PyPI has standardized on .tar.gz for all platforms.</li>\n<li>Stop using a custom distutils command to build extensions. distutils is deprecated.</li>\n<li>Remove the ability to use the deprecated command <code>python setup.py test</code>. Run greenlet tests with your favorite unittest-compatible test runner, e.g., <code>python -m unittest discover greenlet.tests</code>. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/185\">issue 185</a>.</li>\n<li>The directory layout and resulting sdists have changed. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/184\">issue 184</a>.</li>\n<li>greenlet is now always built with support for tracing and garbage collection, and, on Python 3.7 and above, support for context variables. The internal and undocumented C preprocessor macros that could be used to alter that at compile time have been removed (no combination other than the defaults was ever tested). This helps define a stable ABI.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/c0e16261293cb401b643290adbb2d824c7200388\"><code>c0e1626</code></a> Preparing release 1.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/951b2076acc757e93c16dbfd465292485b8f116d\"><code>951b207</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/228\">#228</a> from python-greenlet/github-actions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/fa764abe680a0a0aee138a75dabfa4e147cc9ce2\"><code>fa764ab</code></a> Move to GitHub actions and away from Travis.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/28802e8e40e5b9aa3b29d5a4c2611d7bb5e0a6e3\"><code>28802e8</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/226\">#226</a> from guillaumep/patch-1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/00dc6ebdaa8833d447590ea3b8717fbb4853ce15\"><code>00dc6eb</code></a> Fix typo</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/cdd06239a69cd785c4f62c399689056ff806efaf\"><code>cdd0623</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/221\">#221</a> from skoslowski/patch-1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/58a990acc27edbc972daa00c1a01d000b1acd7e1\"><code>58a990a</code></a> Correct Context Vars PEP citation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/f005b37e7ac32c617d279e4a692bba768d4ab358\"><code>f005b37</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/issues/219\">#219</a> from python-greenlet/issue218</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/9ed87d556f2a67c66027dfcf2acde2c690c20e62\"><code>9ed87d5</code></a> Use PyString_FromString in tp_repr on Py2.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/commit/d4bd91852f7062aa0bb92b58b37d4173712f4226\"><code>d4bd918</code></a> Tweak CHANGES.rst [skip ci]</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/compare/0.4.17...1.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=greenlet&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.4.17&new-version=1.0.0)](https://dependabot.com/compatibility-score/?dependency-name=greenlet&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.4.17&new-version=1.0.0)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

When saving an update, this meant the title was mirrored in the body, and the body was thrown away.  After I figured out my problem, I added this text to catch it, then fixed it with this code.  It is a small change, but may help the next developer running through the tutorial.\r\n\r\nI actually changed `test_update` to the following, but couldn't decide if it made the tutorial easier or harder to understand:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef test_update(client, auth, app):\r\n    auth.login()\r\n    assert client.get('/1/update').status_code == 200\r\n    new_values = {'title': 'updated', 'body': ''}\r\n    client.post('/1/update', data=new_values)\r\n\r\n    with app.app_context():\r\n        db = get_db()\r\n        post = db.execute('SELECT * FROM post WHERE id = 1').fetchone()\r\n\r\n        for field, value in new_values.items():\r\n            assert post[field] == value\r\n```",

Plugin authors may use the public functions of the <code>TerminalReporter</code> instead of accessing the <code>TerminalWriter</code> object directly.</li>\n<li>The <code>--result-log</code> option has been removed.

Which is a bonus as it gives time to consider this change and the implications of it. (I also need to spend some time cleaning up this implementation, yet it serves as a proof of concept).\r\n\r\nI've written [this blog post](https://pgjones.dev/blog/flask-async-quart-sync-2019/) to add some extra context, but I see a key aspect to this change is that whilst it adds `async` support it does not do so throughout and specifically does not support ASGI. This means that Flask is constrained (when using `async`) to have worse performance than the ASGI equivalents. This is necessary as I don't think Flask can be `async` throughout (or support ASGI) whilst being backwards compatible. Yet this change is good overall, in that users would be able to add some async usage to their existing codebases. I would also like to note that they can switch to Quart if their usage becomes mostly async. \r\n\r\nThis allows for async functions to be passed to the Flask class\r\ninstance, for example as a view function,\r\n\r\n    @app.route(\"/\")\r\n    async def index():\r\n        return \"Async hello\"\r\n\r\nthis comes with a cost though of poorer performance than using the\r\nsync equivalent.\r\n",

        "body": "Due to multiple PRs over the last 5 years, the error handler behavior has slowly changed with the goal of being more consistent. However, after #2314 was merged in 1.0.0, these changes all cascaded together to make some inconsistent behavior finally visible.\r\n\r\nAfter *extensive* discussion in #1281, #1291, and #1429, the goal was to make error handlers trigger for exceptions in MRO order, rather than registration order. It formalized the idea that HTTP exception classes and status codes were aliases. Registering a handler for `401` was the same as `Unauthorized`.\r\n\r\nHowever, it (unintentionally?) preserved some old behavior where user errors would only be looked up against a `500` error handler, not a `InternalServerError` handler, even though the goal was for these to be aliases.\r\n\r\n#2314 ensured a more consistent lookup order between blueprints and app error handlers for codes and exception classes. #2362 simplified the code even more, and made it more correct for subclass handling. A side effect of these refactors was that it fixed the preserved behavior, so 500 and `InternalServerError` handlers were equivalent.\r\n\r\nAll these changes had the goal of making error handler registration and triggering more intuitive, and making maintenance easier.\r\n\r\nWhen an unhandled exception is raised, `handle_exception` is triggered so that a final, generic internal server error is returned. Previously, the behavior was to pass the unhandled exception to the 500 error handler, rather than the generic `InternalServerError`. Now that 500 and `InternalServerError` were the same thing and were both considered as handlers for generic error, users who registered a handler for `InternalServerError` or the `HTTPException` base class were surprised to get other random exceptions passed to the handler, rather than strict subclasses (#2778, #2841).\r\n\r\nA fix was proposed in #2983 which continued to preserve the old behavior by making a handler for `500` receive any error, while a handler for `InternalServerError` only received `InternalServerError`. I think this made the code harder to reason about, both for maintainers and for app devs.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'm going the opposite direction and ensuring that those handlers only ever receive `InternalServerError` instances. For unhandled errors, the exception has a new `original_exception` attribute that has the original unhandled error. This will be formalized in Werkzeug 1.0.0, until then `getattr` can be used to check if the attribute is set. The upside of this is that it is safe to assume that all codes and classes are aliases, and will only receive matching classes of errors, which seems to have been the intention of previous discussions, and makes the most sense to me.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that there is no way for this to be 100% backwards compatible for 500 handlers that were written assuming any exception would be passed to them, and I couldn't think of a way to have a useful deprecation warning transition. `e` will always look like `InternalServerError`, possibly making existing generic error pages less useful. However, with the availability of `e.original_exception`, it should be straightforward to get the intended behavior back. Code shouldn't *fail* in the mean time, only be less specific. I think the benefit of more consistent behavior outweighs the drawback.\r\n\r\ncloses #2778 \r\ncloses #2841 \r\ncloses #2983 \r\n\r\nWhile fixing this, I noticed that `finalize_request` was only called if a 500 error handler was found. If no custom handler was registered, then an unhandled error would skip `after_request` functions, saving the session, and sending the `request_finished` signal. This is now fixed, so `finalize_request` is always called.\r\n\r\nTo clear up related confusion about very generic error handlers such as `HTTPException` and `Exception`, more docs have been added to the `errorhandling.rst` page. `handle_exception` has much clearer explanations of what it does too.",

        "body": "## Summary\r\nProvide a new config option to control how JSON is serialized. This would prevent situations where Flask returns a response that is not actually JSON specification compliant.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is an opt-in mechanism. For backwards compatibility, it is disabled by default.\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\nThe default Python JSON serializer is not strictly [RFC-compliant](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#standard-compliance-and-interoperability). In particular, it [outputs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#infinite-and-nan-number-values)\r\n `Infinity` and `NaN` values.\r\n\r\nThis means that by default, JSON APIs written in Flask may produce output that cannot be parsed by the browser, especially when dealing with numerical data.\r\n\r\nEnabling the newly provided `JSON_STRICT` option would treat this scenario as an application error server-side and raise an exception. It would be up to the application developer to identify their preferred handling of such values.\r\n\r\n## Changes and scope\r\nThis adds a new `JSON_STRICT` config option, adding to the [existing config flags](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/config/#JSON_AS_ASCII) that also control serialization. \r\n\r\nThe default value is chosen to leave existing applications unaffected. If `JSON_STRICT` is `True`, the application will raise an error in situations where it previously would have produced invalid JSON. \r\n\r\n## Previous discussion\r\nThis pitfall has been noted previously elsewhere. Others have expressed an interest in a simple, explicit configurable error option, but I am not aware of any previous pull requests that implemented the idea.\r\n\r\n- https://coderwall.com/p/amb0va/python-s-json-module-does-not-always-produce-valid-json\r\n- https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO/issues/208\r\n\r\nParticularly due to backwards compatibility concerns, the Python standard library has rejected previous suggestions to change the default `json` module behavior:\r\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue26105\r\n\r\n## Evaluation of alternatives\r\nLibraries such as `simplejson` [provide](https://simplejson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#simplejson.dumps) an [ECMA-262 compliant](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/8.0/index.html#sec-serializejsonproperty) `ignore_nan` option, in which out-of-range values are serialized as `null`.\r\n\r\nHowever, this option is not supported by the Python standard library, and in practice the best choice of replacement value may be somewhat application specific.\r\n",

The value of `FLASK_APP` is determined through introspection if not provided. If a value for `FLASK_APP` cannot be determined, then the original `app.run()` function is used.\r\n- Running `python myapp.py` with any arguments redirects to the `flask` command with the same arguments. For example: `python myapp.py --help` is the same as `flask --help`, `python myapp.py shell` starts the shell, and so on. Custom cli commands are also supported.\r\n- If the script passes `host` or `port` arguments in `app.run()`, those are also passed on to the `flask run` command in the cli module.\r\n- If the script calls `app.run(debug=True)` then `FLASK_ENV=development` is added to the environment (only if `FLASK_ENV` is not set).\r\n- If the `app.run()` call specifies any custom settings besides `host`, `port`, and `debug`, then the original logic is used for now. I can go through all the available options to `run_simple()` and see if there are other ones that can be supported through the cli.",

This patch greatly reduces the logging configuration that Flask does.\r\n\r\n* Remove `LOGGER_NAME` and `LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY` configuration.\r\n* `app.logger` is always named `'flask.app'`. Use the `'flask'` namespace to allow other logging from Flask in the future.\r\n* Don't use a `Logger` subclass to override `getEffectiveLevel`. Call `setLevel` when the logger is first accessed, based on `app.debug`, instead of checking `debug` for every message.\r\n* Only one handler with one format is added, instead of different formats for production and development.\r\n* A handler is only added if there are no handlers configured that would handle the logger's `getEffectiveLevel`.\r\n* Handlers are never removed.\r\n* The `default_handler` is accessible so that it can be passed to `removeHandler` in case the user wants to get rid of the default handler after it is configured.\r\n* The proxy stream to `environ['wsgi.errors']` is exposed as `wsgi_errors_stream`, in case the user wants to use it in their own configuration.\r\n* Logging documentation is split from error handling documentation and reorganized to address the key concepts.\r\n* Added documentation for injecting request information into messages.\r\n* Logging tests are split into a separate module.\r\n* Some previously miscategorized tests are correctly organized.",

Because of the current way things are working, the req/res will not be logged as well as not be applied the P3P header.\nCurrently there is no way to intercept ALL requests and responses for these use cases.\n\nA simple solution, proposd in this PR is to process exception responses similarly to successful responses. This could be a breaking change to some library consumers so I'm putting it up as an RFC.\n\n[tests to come soon]\n",

Updated contribution guide to replace the `py.test`, `tox`, and coverage instructions with the `make` versions. Consistent/similar commands should be easier to remember? Also ensures everyone runs the same tests every time.\n\nApologies if I globbed too much into one PR, happy to edit if needed.\n",

Although it seems that the `template_folder` Blueprint argument would have this meaning this is not actually the case. \nThis argument will only add the `template_folder` as one of the directories to search in. \n\nWith this change a template passed to `render_template` can be prefixed with `./` to indicate that it should not search in the root template directory, but in a subdirectory of it with the name of the blueprint.\n",

I changed it so that both `jsonify(1,2,3)` and `jsonify([1,2,3])` serialize to `[1,2,3]` as I think that's the more intuitive behavior.\n- Per the discussion in #1209 & #248, I didn't create a separate config variable to modify this behavior. \n\nI know it'd be nice to incorporate a fix for #1443 in here as well, but I don't fully understand the issue there. So let's get this merged, and then tackle that issue in a followup PR.\n\nFix #170, #248, #510, #673, #1177 and check one of the boxes on #1182 \n",

Yet I cannot help but suspect that the current implementation of function `with_metaclass` is just a bit too much.\n\nWhy does the dummy metaclass extend the one to apply?\n\nIt never utilizes any of the base class' resources, except for the base class itself. Since this is done by direct invocation (not via `super()` or something), there should be no need to inherit from the caller-provided type in the first place.\n\nFurthermore, given that the above obvservation is correct, there should be no need to explicitly utilize `type.__call__` and `type.__init__` any more. Not only because one can directly inherit from `type` here, but also because both seem to be required due to the aforementioned inheritance only: If the given `meta` class implements custom magic, the creation of the `temporary_class` could fail. Or even worse; succeed but silently misinterprete arguments.\n\nSpeaking of the `temporary_class` creation (and still assuming all of the above assumptions to be correct): There's no need to do that via the `metaclass` constructor at all, which actually saves not only the additional function call but also the condition within `__new__`.\n\nGiven I didn't miss something (and there is indeed no actual reason for the metaclass to extend the one to apply), then I believe the patch suggested with this pull request to significantly improve the code without changing any of the expected behavior.\n",

I think it also makes sense to remove it from the [Flask extensions list](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) (where's the repo for that?)\n\n[Here's a 2 year old ticket on Bitbucket that fixes Python 3 support](https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-uploads/pull-request/5/modernizing/diff). No reply what-so-ever from @leafstorm. His last public activity on Bitbucket was three years ago.\n\nI'll e-mail him with a reference to this ticket to see if we can get a reply. Perhaps with this ticket we can get the project owner's attention.\n\nThe best alternative would of course be to get development going on the project again, perhaps by adding more contributors to the project.

So instead I was thinking of adding the ValueError content to the shell console or to the response body. By just adding the exception to the response body it at least improves the 400 message and probably will make it easier to debug. The response body (which is also in the gist above) would now look like:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\n<title>400 Bad Request</title>\n<h1>Bad Request</h1>\n<p>No JSON object could be decoded</p>\n```\n\nIf this isn't really that helpful perhaps I can just output the exception details to the console?

But when I try to register my frontend blueprint with follow code, my static css, images, js don't load.\n\n``` python\nfront = Blueprint('front', __name__, static_folder='static', template_folder='./templates', url_prefix='/')\n```\n\nAfter debugging I found the problem. It's when try to register route, it tries to register route like //static (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/flask/blueprints.py#L68)\n\nAnd then when use url_for the werkzeug routing.py (https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug/blob/master/werkzeug/routing.py#L1655) resolve url_for //static/filename it found a problem beacause there are two rules like this: \n\n``` python\n[<Rule '/static/<filename>' (HEAD, OPTIONS, GET) -> static>, <Rule '//static/<filename>' (HEAD, OPTIONS, GET) -> front.static>]\n```\n\nSo, a simple solution like concatenate a `blueprint.name` before url_prefix when is \"/\" resolve this conflict and now we can  use `url_for('front.static', filename='2.jpg')` routing resolves without problem.\n",

If the policy is `'never'`, the handlers do not need to be added and such cleanup `del logger.handlers[:]` is not necessary.\n\nThe test I added describes my use case (and I believe everyone's in https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/issues/641) quite accurately, and I think it is a reasonable one. \n\nMy solution to not install handlers is different than the previous situation, which would always install them and then would do a check on each invocation of `handler.emit`. That means that if someone relied on this check and was for some reason dynamically modifying the app's configuration to change the logging policy while the app was running, it won't work any more. But, to me this seems more like an implementation artifact than a valid use-case.\n",

It says \"object is not iterable\", even though your custom json encoder will turn it into an iterable in a moment.  This is because Flask is trying to make it into a dict before that can happen.\n\nThis patch fixes this case.  Also it allows you to return other legitimate singular json values such as integers and strings.  Hopefully this doesn't raise any security issues.  If it does, someone else may wish to handle this more carefully.\n",

We can assume _having `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME` configured_ indicates that a permanent session is expected\n2. Add another configuration key to control how the session object should be initialized.\n## Evaluation and Fix\n\nFor alternative 1: In python, explicit is always better than implicit. Plus, since we already have `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME` default to 30 days, that means if we go this route, the default session behavior will change from transient to permanent. This breaks backward compatibility\nAlternative 2 is the way to go\n",

All the tests pass.\n\nI also couldn't figure out where a test should go for this, or if a test should even be added. I couldn't find any tests for `send_from_directory` (there are some for `send_file`), and I also didn't know the best way for using a package app in a test. If you'd like tests added for this behavior I'd be happy to write them with a few pointers on how to approach it.\n",

        "body": "Currently jinja environment checks for changes in the template file every time you need to render it. But disk I/O is costly and it may be viable to disable this feature in production.\n\nI added `TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD` config option which allows to set `auto_reload` attribute of `jinja2.Environment` to `False` when the application is running in non-debug mode. This allows to make the template rendering a little more efficient because it disables a checking of changing templates file each time before template is rendered.\n\nIn some situations, this could give a significant increase of performance (from 60 to 200 rps in my case). Unfortunately, if you want to do the same by overriding of `Flask.jinja_options` attribute, it would be uncomfortable because a reloading of templates is needed for debugging.\n\nThis change should not affect existing applications. Also, it might make sense to disable reloading by default.\n",

The fix uses `os.path.join` to generate a path suitable for the current system.\n2. In `test_send_file_object` the file is first opened in text mode, which converts newlines to `\\n`. However, later on the same file is opened in binary mode using `app.open_resource`, and so newlines are not converted. On Windows this leads to a failing test because Git converts all newlines to `\\r\\n` on checkout. Basically, when opening in text mode we get `\\n` newlines, and when opening in binary mode we get `\\r\\n` newlines. The fix solves this by opening the file in binary mode the first time, as well.\n",

It now matches /static, /static/, and everything below it. /staticfoo is no longer matched.\n- Sven\n",

It can be changed in the future if some other data type becomes common, but I believe this is a reasonable default.\n",

Right now, this is a good foreword for the first group: its examples cover advanced topics that newer users won't understand, and whose only effect will be to scare those users. I would recommend splitting the foreword into two parts: (1) For new users (2) For experienced coders. This first portion would cover, in broad strokes, Flask's philosophy: convention over configuration, what \"micro\" means, \"simple tasks should be simple\", etc. The second portion, which we may want to hide on another page, will cover the implementation details of Flask's design decisions that advanced users will want to know about, such as the use of thread-local objects.\n\nIf that's a structure the community feels good about, I'd be happy to draft it up.\n",

        "body": "I needed this method to adjust the cache control headers for .js files that one of my applications was statically serving.  The default expiration is buried in an argument to `send_file` and is set to 12 hours.  There was no good way to adjust this value previously.  So I added a new method to `_PackageBoundObject` named `get_static_file_options` that returns a dict (empty by default) of keywords to pass into `send_file`.  This can be overridden in the `flask.Flask` derivative to adjust values based on the debug flag or filename.\n",

The one difference is a kind of \"manager\" pattern where the initialized extension returns a manager that has the db connection on it.\n\nLet me know if this works for you. Obviously, I'm open to reworking if needed.\n\nMatt\n",
