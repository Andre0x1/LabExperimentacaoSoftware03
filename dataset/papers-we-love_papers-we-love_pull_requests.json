It forms the basis for most non-concurrent incremental collectors as well. No matter where you stand on garbage collection, I think it\u2019s useful (and interesting!) to know how collectors work, and this is one paper you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to avoid when delving into the matter; despite the claim in the paper\u2019s introduction that \u201cit has hardly been our purpose to contribute specifically to the art of garbage collection, and consequently no practical significance is claimed for our solution\u201d, this is definitely one of the most important and influential papers on GC ever written.\r\n",

        "body": "Hi! \ud83d\udc4b\r\n\r\nI'm a PhD student at Lancaster University and I research and work on unikernels.  After finding `papers-we-love` and seeing `unikernels` subdirectory, I was quick to fork and add some of my favourite papers that I've read on unikernels.  In this commit, I introduce 53 links to pdfs in the public domain or, at the very least, links to the publisher's public citation page of the peer reviewed paper.  \r\n\r\nThe papers have been organised in chronology following the influence of unikernels, particularly focusing on papers which identify traits in increasing application security, portability and performance with respect to its runtime.  This follows from the early definitions, such as microkernels which attempt to increase application portability by only facilitating reliable Inter-Process Communication (IPC).  Second-wave follows the centralizastion of commodity hardware into 'the cloud' and the realization of increasing application performance with networked, mult-core, many user systems.\r\n\r\nIn the unikernels section, I start with links to a number of papers which describe the concept of unikernels and the need for increasing performance in the cloud and how well tuned Virtual Machines (VMs) can aid in increasing performance.  Following this section is a link to relevant published articles of a number of unikernel/libOS implementations. There are a number of links to articles which compare the performance of unikernels themselves to similar counterparts including monolithic OSes and containers. Finally, unikernels have been used in a number of interesting scenarios, and the applications of unikernels section has links to papers which implement the unikernel model in various scenarios following the claims of their performance and security benefits.",

Some are dazzling, some are pedestrian, some are insightful, and some reward long periods of quiet contemplation. They stir up an emotional reaction that goes beyond the strictly rational, and can often be deeply personal.\r\n> \r\n> In graduate school, during a period of identity crisis, I came across Matthias Felleisen's \u201cOn the Expressive Power of Programming Languages\u201d. At a time when the world was ruled by C++, I had immersed myself in Scheme, so I always looked skeptically at mainstream linguistic claims. However, the language wars seemed beyond rational discourse. So the idea that someone could take a concept as nebulous as \u201cexpressiveness&rdquo and formalize it was already a revelation. But the beauty of this paper goes well beyond that: it also lies in the cleanliness of the approach, the correspondence of the formalism to intuition, and the tautness of its execution.\r\n> \r\n> It was the most stunning paper I had ever read, and remains so. It's like the poem that never leaves your soul.\r\n> \r\n\r\n- Shriram Krishnamurthi is speaking on this paper at PWL2019\r\n",

Knuth's writings have been extremely\n  important to the field of computer science, and I think that most of\n  his papers would fit in well here. This one introduces computational\n  complexity and the benefits/limits of computing, then it dives into\n  several combinatorial problems.\n\n  I find it interesting because 1) it's a neat view of the possibilities and\n  limitations of computation early on, and 2) the problems that he lays out\n  are interesting exercises even today.\n\n---\n#### Changes\n- add: _Combinatorial Analysis and Computers_ (1965) to\n       `combinatory_logic/README.md` list\n- add: year to the other paper in the README\n- fix: tweak format of papers README for readability\n#### Decisions:\n- I put this in the `combinatory_logic` folder, but I think it would\n  also fit in the `comp_sci_fundamentals_and_history` folder (given\n  Knuth's historical importance to the field and the more\n  theoretical nature of the paper). This seemed more direct.\n",

I've seen it mentioned in several other popular\n  media as well, including John Hopkin's very popular online Data\n  Science MOOC.\n\n  The main reason that I'm adding this paper, however, is because of\n  how well-written it is. I don't come from a data science background,\n  but after reading this paper, I walked away with a decent\n  understanding of the significance of Wickham's research and\n  standardization efforts, the current (circa 2014) state of the field,\n  and many of the technical details associated with his method of data\n  tidying. It was easy to read, despite my lacking data science\n  background, but it's clear that Wickham did not \"dumb down\" the\n  content in order to accomplish that.\n\n  I believe that other chapters and independent readers will find this\n  to be an interesting, enjoyable paper, and I believe that it will\n  continue to affect the field of data cleaning.\n\n  _This paper will be presented at the October meeting of Papers We Love\n  Washington, D.C. & Northern VA._\n#### Copyright Information\n\nThe raw paper can be legally included in this repository. _Tidy Data_\n  falls under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License],\n  which allows for sharing and adaptation with attribution.\n\n  [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License]:\n    https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n### PR Major Changes\n\nThe following major changes were made:\n- Create the `./data_science` directory\n- Add the _Tidy Data_ pdf\n- Create/update the `./data_science` README with the article\n  information (including the scroll icon, link to the source, author,\n  and publication year)\n#### Decisions and Rationale\n- Since no relevant folder existed, I created the `./data_science`\n  directory. This is a broad subject, but until the number of articles\n  get to be unmanageable, I think that keeping them together will help\n  people find what they're interested in.\n- The README does have a sub-category list (_Tidy Data_ is under \"Data\n  Cleaning\"), but there is no corresponding subdirectory. This is\n  because there are few enough raw articles that someone browsing the\n  directory listing won't benefit from the subfolder (but it will cost\n  them an extra click), but someone skimming the README might want to\n  know more about the article categorization.\n- The README listing includes scroll/title/author/link to source, but\n  it does not include any abstract/rationale. The different READMEs\n  take different approaches here, but this seems to be the best\n  trade-off between a concise listing and providing useful\n  information. I'm happy to add a rationale or summary if it would be\n  useful though.\n",

The problem of motion planning scales exponentially with the\ndegrees of freedom a robot has and the degrees of freedom the obstacles\nin an environment have. Thus, planning with high degrees of freedom leads to many problems\nsuch as incompleteness and extremely slow speed. The PRM method was the first to\npropose a sampling-based stratey to deal with motion planning and\ncreated a practical methed for offline planning of robot manipulators.\nThe RRT method modified PRM by using a tree structure rather than a\ngraph so that non-holonomic and other constraints could be considered\nwhen planning.\n\nThe Instantaneous Trajectory Generation method is relatively new, but\nvery important. It allows for extremely fast trajectory generation for\nrobots of high degrees of freedom (motion states generated within 1\nmillisecond). It has been used to implement robot sword fighting and\nother activities that require fast reaction-based planning. The author\nstarted a business based simply on the work and has shown the\nalgorithm's success in many robot applications.\n",
