I took the initiative to submit a [\"Pull Request\"](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/pull/342) adding it in \"Introduction to Computer Science\" course.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and effort in maintaining this valuable resource :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMouaaz",

I still think, however, that CS 6650 serves a purpose, because this subject matter isn't currently addressed by any other course listed in the readme. In the future, if someone finds a course on this subject that does have assignments to go with it, they will hopefully delete my entry and replace it with their own. Aside from that, I also got rid of the extra bullet point that I somehow created at line 615, in pr #93.\n\n@robbyoconnor I deleted .DS_Store, as you mentioned. I'm not sure why, or how, that file somehow finds its way into my commits from time to time.\n",
