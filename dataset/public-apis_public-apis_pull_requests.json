This will help with future improvements.\r\n- Updated actions to work with the new changes\r\n- Action to run the tests from the validation scripts\r\n- Only check for duplicate links when a push occurs. This is useful for quicker feedback, as checking to see if many links are working takes time.\r\n- Check all README links only 00h\r\n- Documentation to know how to use all scripts in your environment",

I do know there was a previous PR filed, not that long ago, to do the same. This is PR #2338.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe the Slovenia government in fact does have an Open Data API. I will attempt to explain here how it works, as I understand it.\r\n\r\nThe main portal is available at https://podatki.gov.si/\r\n\r\nThis offers content in traditional \"download a CSV\"/\"download a XML\"-style, but also offers an API! Not sure if it wasn't available at the time of the previous PR, or if it was missed.\r\nItems labelled as \"PROG. VMESNIK\" showcase having an API, and it seems there is a number of such items.\r\n\r\nExample: https://podatki.gov.si/dataset/seznam-praznikov-in-dela-prostih-dni-v-republiki-sloveniji\r\nClick on \"Prog. vmesnik\" and you can see the examples for how to query by clicking on \"Poizvedovanje \u00bb\".\r\n\r\nIt supports two ways of accessing:\r\n- Normal access, e.g. just get parameters.\r\n- SQL-like access (I can't say I super understand this)\r\n\r\nExample, querying for holidays that occur on a Saturday: https://podatki.gov.si/api/3/action/datastore_search?resource_id=eb8b25ea-5c00-4817-a670-26e1023677c6&q=sobota\r\n\r\nThe website is built on CKAN.",

The providers Impala and Laya have not yet been added to the repo. This PR adds them to the Transportation category, but I'm not 100% sure they should be in there since they are broader than transportation - Impala is all about selling hotel rooms and making commissions, while Laya deals with trip planning and suggests packages for flights, vehicles and accommodation.\r\n\r\nI am not familiar with these APIs myself, if they are not super useful, it may not be worth adding to the repo, and PR #1506 could be closed out. I did check that the links are accurate, that they have free tiers, require API keys to use and support HTTPS. I was not able to verify CORS support.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for taking the time to work on a Pull Request for this project! -->\r\n<!-- To ensure your PR is dealt with swiftly please check the following: -->\r\n- [x] My submission is formatted according to the guidelines in the [contributing guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] My addition is ordered alphabetically\r\n- [x] My submission has a useful description\r\n- [x] The description does not have more than 100 characters\r\n- [x] The description does not end with punctuation\r\n- [x] Each table column is padded with one space on either side\r\n- [x] I have searched the repository for any relevant issues or pull requests\r\n- [x] Any category I am creating has the minimum requirement of 3 items\r\n- [x] All changes have been [squashed][squash-link] into a single commit\r\n\r\n[squash-link]: <https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-android/wiki/Squash-All-Commits-Related-to-a-Single-Issue-into-a-Single-Commit>\r\n",

This section contains the status of the GitHub action;\r\n\r\n- Create a **The Project** section in header. This section contains some useful information for the community, such as the contribution guide, the project API and more;\r\n\r\n- Create a **Currently Active Maintainers** section in header. I think it can be useful for the community to know who the maintainers of a project are explicitly, without having to look for that information by analyzing the frequency of commits, responses to issues and pull requests, etc. This section is ordered based on activity.\r\n\r\n- Create a **Alternative sites for the project (unofficials)** section in header. As discussed in issue #1919, this section adds some community made sites that use data from Public APIs. This section is ordered based on what was discussed in #1919.\r\nOriginal issues:\r\n#1919 \r\n#1716 \r\n#1852 \r\n\r\nPreview:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50463866/130598660-7847e71a-0d94-411a-a4a4-9469585d5c46.png)\r\n\r\nThis new structure makes viewing easier and more enjoyable than the previous one. It will also be useful when activating GitHub Sponsors, as the structure is practically ready (between the header and the index section).\r\n\r\nI also improved the script that collects the links from the `README.md` file. Now it's not necessary to keep a list of ignored links, the script will always start after the index section, so it won't collect any header links.\r\n",

Most of these are just blurbs rather  than elegantly crafted English prose.\r\n- Add a check to make sure each segment is padded by exactly 1 space\r\n- Stop using a stupid variable (`fail_flag`) that is set over and over again and instead store errors in an array to be printed at the end. The length of the array can then be referenced to indicate the number of errors (hopefully 0!)\r\n- Now that we have access to the number of errors, why not set the exit code to that number? In the case of `n` number of errors, the bash script that calls the validator will have access to the number of errors if it ever wants to reference that in the future.\r\n- minor structure changes to make maintaining and extending this easier over time\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think and if you have any other ideas, I'm all ears!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This validation checks for valid auth values, markdown link syntax, and a few other goodies.\r\n\r\nI plan to add more checks to this soon, but my plan is to merge in the CI changes quickly to stop having pull requests fail for no good reason - and to give maintainers a break from having to point out simple fixes :)",

You can get at the data directly with a link like this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuhnrl30/public-apis/gh-pages/_data/apis.json.\r\n\r\n2. Add the ability to search across 4 columns- name, description, auth type, and category. \r\n\r\nYou can demo the site on my fork of the repo: http://ryankuhn.net/public-apis.  If accepted, we'd have to do a few tweaks to move it to Todd's repo e.g. changing the repo link in right side of the header.",

I worked out a Node.js script that will parse through all the various tables and build a JSON object from all the tables. In the deploy script, I create both a minified and unminified version of the JSON. The last little piece of this is setting up Travis to create these JSON files on master builds and push them up to GitHub afterwards. Would love to hear some thoughts on this :)",
