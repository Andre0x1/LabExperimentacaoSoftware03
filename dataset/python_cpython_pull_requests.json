The solution is not elegant enough as we could have a real `SyntaxError` which we want to debug at run-time. #84583 gave an example with `ast.literal_eval('')`. This could happen in other scenarios as well, when we compile dynamically generated code.\r\n\r\nThe original check for `SyntaxError` was just to prevent `pdb` from stuck, we can easily do that by moving the `pdb._user_requested_quit` outside of the try statement, so the `quit` request from post-mortem mode can be respected too.\r\n\r\nThis has one minor behavior change - when the user tries to \"exit\" from the post mortem debugging, for example, using Ctrl+D or `quit` command, `pdb` used to restart the program, now it will exit.\r\n\r\nI think this is a more reasonable behavior - we told the users explicitly to use `cont` and `step` to restart the program, and `exit` should just mean \"exit\".\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-84583 -->\n* Issue: gh-84583\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

        "body": "The fix here is based on fully buying into the idea that `inst` is just syntactic sugar for an `op` and `macro`, and the principle that one does not ever override a macro, one overrides only the definition of an op; `override inst` is equivalent to `override op`. One can freely override an op (whether originally defined via `op` or implicitly via `inst`) that may be part of one or several macros (explicit or implicit), and the override will be reflected in the generated contents of each macro.\r\n\r\nI think this approach makes sense; since explicitly-defined macros have never supported overrides, it's not clear why we should try to special-case some concept of overriding implicitly-defined macros.\r\n\r\nI also _think_ this approach should meet all our actual override needs; if we discover that I'm wrong, we can propose a later PR to generally add support for macro overrides.\r\n\r\nThis also implies some behavioral changes. The idea of a \"placeholder comment\" for overrides, or trying to emit the override contents later in the output, no longer makes much sense, since ops do not directly appear in the output, only macros do, and the macro itself is not overridden.\r\n\r\nWe could add an \"// override\" comment in some form; I didn't do that here and don't think it's needed. If you are trying to debug why your generated cases look the way they do, you should be enabling `#line` directives, which will give you much clearer provenance details.\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-109287 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-109287\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

        "body": "The test had an instability issue due to the ordering of the dummy queue operation and the real wakeup pipe operations. Both primitives are thread safe but not done atomically as a single update and may interleave arbitrarily. With the old order of operations this can lead to an incorrect state where the dummy queue is full but the wakeup pipe is empty. By swapping the order in clear() I think this can no longer happen in any possible operation interleaving (famous last words).\r\n\r\nThis is a minimal update to fix the issue. Long term it might be better to rewrite the test along the lines of https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/110129 where we make it possible to override the wakeup message and cause the blocking behaviour that way instead of the small dummy queue used now. Less mocking is usually better and the test can be faster as well. It does require a minor modification to the implementation and there were other issues in https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/110129 but the general test idea seems better than the current solution.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for your contribution!\r\nPlease read this comment in its entirety.

        "body": "`warnings` is a pretty cheap import, so the import-time saving from deferring it is usually pretty minimal. However, it's also a textbook example of an import that should be deferred wherever reasonable. Most of the time, it's only imported so that a `DeprecationWarning` can be emitted, and we should try to make it so that users only have to pay the (small) performance penalty from it being imported if they actually hit the specific code path that's deprecated.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, since the performance impact of importing `warnings` is so small, I've tried to avoid modules that make multiple uses of `warnings` -- it's not particularly DRY to have import warnings repeated several times in the same module. The one exception I made here is `argparse`: `argparse` really should be importing the absolute minimum set of modules given that it's a CLI framework (see #74338 for previous discussion).\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-109653 -->\n* Issue: gh-109653\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

        "body": "In a few places we switch to another interpreter without knowing if it has a thread state associated with the current thread.  For the main interpreter there wasn't much of a problem, but for subinterpreters we were mostly okay re-using the tstate created with the interpreter (located via `PyInterpreterState_ThreadHead()`).  There was a good chance that tstate wasn't actually in use by another thread.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are no guarantees of that.  Furthermore, re-using an already used tstate is currently fragile.  To address this, now we create a new thread state in each of those places and use it.\r\n\r\nOne consequence of this change is that `PyInterpreterState_ThreadHead()` may not return `NULL` (though that won't happen for the main interpreter).\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-109860 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-109860\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

This also widens the check, I think this is a good thing.\r\n\r\n# 3. \r\n\r\n~Remove `docs_modified(doc_files)` from patchcheck, it merely printed out whether any docs files were modified.

Well, `email.utils` is imported by `email.message`, and `email.message` is imported by lots of other stdlib modules: `urllib.parse`, `mailbox`, and `importlib.metadata`. Improving the import time of this module has a cascading effect through lots of the rest of the standard library.\r\n\r\nA lot of the import cost of `email.utils` has to do with the `make_msgid` function, which requires the `random` and `socket` modules. This function is used by many third-party libraries, but isn't used at all by any of the stdlib modules that import `email.utils`. This patch moves the function into a separate submodule.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-109653 -->\n* Issue: gh-109653\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

Also, msvcrt is missing the set_error_mode constants _OUT_TO_DEFAULT, _OUT_TO_STDERR, _OUT_TO_MSGBOX, and _REPORT_ERRMODE.\r\n> \r\n> SetErrorMode [1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680621) and the SEM_* constants are defined in msvcrt, for convenience I suppose. They're not related to the CRT. I think they should be aliased in the os module and documented there. GetErrorMode [2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679355) can also be provided in Python 3.5+. It would be useful to also provide SetThreadErrorMode [3](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd553630) and GetThreadErrorMode conditionally in Windows 7+, which is practically all Windows users nowadays.\r\n\r\nThis PR finished it, except the `SetErrorMode` function and related constants alias to os module.

E.g. in this example, the reference to `T` in D's bases (which is in a nested annotation scope, since `D` is generic) should have `GLOBAL_IMPLICIT` scope, which results in it using `LOAD_FROM_DICT_OR_GLOBALS` (where the dict is the class namespace); just as if it were a reference directly in C's scope:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef f():\r\n    T = str\r\n    class C:\r\n        T = int\r\n        class D[U](T):\r\n            pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in the case where the same name is also free in a child scope of the annotation scope (replace `pass` with `T` in the above example), it must be included in the free vars of the annotation scope, so that the child scope has access to the cell when its closure is constructed.\r\n\r\nThe symbol flag `DEF_CLASS_FREE` is intended for these class-scope cases, where a name must have a scope other than `FREE` in order for references to it to behave correctly, but must still be included in freevars because it is free in a child scope.\r\n\r\nSo we must add `DEF_CLASS_FREE` to such names not only in class scopes, but also in annotation scopes enclosed by class scopes.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we only added `DEF_CLASS_FREE` if the name was bound in the class scope; otherwise, it would be `FREE` anyway and `DEF_CLASS_FREE` would be redundant. To preserve this check in annotation scope cases, we'd have to check if the name is bound in the enclosing class scope, not the annotation scope. But this check is unnecessary, since a redundant `DEF_CLASS_FREE` on a `FREE` name is harmless; either way the name will be added to freevars, and this is the only impact of `DEF_CLASS_FREE`. So it's simpler to just remove the check.\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-109219 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-109219\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

The design is based on WebKit's `WTF::Lock`.\r\n\r\nPyMutex is built using the `_PyParkingLot` APIs, which provides a cross-platform futex-like API (based on WebKit's `WTF::ParkingLot`). This internal API will be used for building other synchronization primitives used to implement PEP 703, such as one-time initialization and events.\r\n\r\nThis also includes tests and a mini benchmark in `Tools/lockbench/lockbench.py` to compare with the existing `PyThread_type_lock`.\r\n\r\nUncontended acquisition + release:\r\nLinux (x86-64): PyMutex: 11 ns, PyThread_type_lock: 44 ns\r\nmacOS (arm64): PyMutex: 13 ns, PyThread_type_lock: 18 ns\r\nWindows (x86-64): PyMutex: 13 ns, PyThread_type_lock: 38 ns\r\n\r\n### PR Overview\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this PR is to implement `PyMutex`, but there are a number of support pieces (described below).\r\n\r\n* `PyMutex`: A 1-byte lock that doesn't require memory allocation to initialize and is generally faster than the existing `PyThread_type_lock`. The API is internal only for now.\r\n* `_PyParking_Lot`: A futex-like API based on the API of the same name in WebKit. Used to implement `PyMutex`.\r\n* `_PyRawMutex`: A word sized lock used to implement `_PyParking_Lot`\r\n* `PyEvent`: a one time event. This was used a bunch in the \"nogil\" fork and is useful for testing the `PyMutex` implementation, so I've included it as part of the PR.\r\n* `pycore_llist.h`: Defines common operations on doubly-linked list. Not strictly necessary (could do the list operations manually), but they come up frequently in the \"nogil\" fork. (Similar to https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?queue)\r\n\r\n### Linked issue\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-108724 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-108724\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

        "body": "This addresses feedback on the core dev Discord, that it's too hard to read the rendered versions of issues on the tracker now, due to the fact that the \"boilerplate-y\" fields such as the Python versions tested on are at the top of the template, and these have to be skimmed past before you get to the core bug description itself.\r\n\r\nThe changes are:\r\n- Move the main issue description so that it's the first field in every issue template. This increases the risk that people will not fill in the other fields, but I think it's a good trade-off. I agree with the criticisms that the current issue templates mean that you have to wade through too much text before you can find out what the issue is actually about.\r\n- Reduce the number of fields in the \"bug report\" template:\r\n  - Get rid of the checkboxes; just incorporate the \"please check the issue tracker for duplicates\" note into the MarkDown paragraph at the top\r\n  - Get rid of the field asking for the output of `python -VV`. In some situations this is useful, but most of the time it's not, and this field is adding noise to every rendered issue report. In situations where we actually _need_ this information, we can just ask the reporter for it. I've kept this field in the \"crash report\" template, though, for two reasons: firstly, this information is more likely to be useful for crash reports; and secondly, we get many fewer crash reports than we do bug reports, so the concern about adding excessive amounts of noise to the issue tracker has much less weight.\r\n\r\nAs before, these are already merged into the `main` branch on my CPython fork, so you can try out making issues at https://github.com/AlexWaygood/cpython/issues/new/choose to get a feel for what it's like.\r\n\r\nExamples of rendered issues:\r\n- Bug: https://github.com/AlexWaygood/cpython/issues/19\r\n- Feature: https://github.com/AlexWaygood/cpython/issues/20\r\n- Crash: https://github.com/AlexWaygood/cpython/issues/22",

It is difficult to not include them, because they are needed when the parsing code is not inlined, and this depends not only on the specified converter, but on other converters and other used features.\r\n\r\nThere is a behavior change: converters like `_PyLong_UnsignedShort_Converter` raise ValueError for negative integer, but the inlined code raise OverflowError. It is very difficult to detect negative integer in the limited C API. It can be fixed by changing exception in `PyLong_AsUnsignedLong` (see #74019).\r\n\r\nI also reorganized the code for keyword parameters, so it will be easier to enable inlining once we add a public version of `_PyArg_UnpackKeywords` in the limited C API, which is the only stopper.\r\n\r\nAll tests (except one) are passed with using the limited C API (if possible).\r\n\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-108494 -->\n* Issue: gh-108494\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

(The fact that I couldn't think of great variable names was the reason why I didn't initially go with this approach in #108112, FWIW. I'm still not _entirely_ sure that this improves the code, really, but it does make the type checkers happier.

While this has helped motivate large-scale cleanup of many of these warnings, as I commented when this was first deployed it has naturally led to a serious amount of noise, annoyance and confusion for PR authors seeing warnings on lines they had nothing to do with, which in turn leads to the understandable temptation for authors to ignore valid warnings or just silencing them, hiding rather than fixing the underlying defect.\r\n\r\nThe solution is, naturally,  to only show warnings on modified lines, which is somewhat complicated by the fact that warning lines are only necessarily accurate at the paragraph level, requiring some additional processing. After much delay and burnout, I've finally gotten around to implementing it myself with this PR.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, the script now works equally as well locally as remotely; just pass the commits/branches/tags to compare with `--check-and-annotate-changes <base> <branch>`, or use the default (comparing the changes on the current `HEAD` with the merge base in the local `main`).

It doesn't make sense to check both of these boxes; a dropdown makes more sense here.\r\n- Get rid of the demand that people provide a one-sentence summary of their proposal. This makes sense for some feature proposals, but not for others. For people who want to provide a summary, they can probably just integrate it into the main body of their feature proposal.\r\n\r\nAs before, I've pushed these changes to the `main` branch of my GitHub form, so you can try creating an issue at https://github.com/AlexWaygood/cpython to see how the form renders.",

        "body": "The type watcher implementation adds `char tp_watched;` to the `PyTypeObject` struct, and then in `PyType_Modified` it assigns `int bits = type->tp_watched;` and then treats `bits` as a bitset, expecting that only the low 8 bits should ever be set.\r\n\r\nOn platforms where `char` is signed (e.g. x86), if the top bit in `tp_watched` is set, the cast to `int bits` will sign-extend with 1s, and we will thus have a lot of high bits set in `bits` that are not supposed to ever be set.\r\n\r\nOn x86 in a debug build, without the fix in this PR, the new test hits the assertion in `PyType_Modified` that only bit positions `< TYPE_MAX_WATCHERS` should be set, and aborts.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple: `tp_watched` should be defined as `unsigned char` so that it is zero-extended, not sign-extended.\r\n\r\nNote that the test is carefully designed to not assume there are no type watchers already active. It doesn't attempt to register a fixed number of type watchers, instead it just registers type watchers until it reaches `TYPE_MAX_WATCHERS - 1`, the last available slot and the one that can trigger this bug (since it will set the highest bit in `tp_watched` when watching a type.)\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-91051 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-91051\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

        "body": "This is joint work by @JuliaPoo and me, supported by the NUS TEST Lab.\r\n\r\n~~This implements a subset of partial evaluation (specifically, constant propagation), using a technique described for our type propagation in our [Tier 2 interpreter report](https://github.com/Fidget-Spinner/cpython/blob/tier2_interpreter_no_separate_eval_no_tracer_contiguous_bbs/report/CPython_Tier_2_LBBV_Report_For_Repo.pdf) and abstract interpretation over uops.~~\r\n\r\nThe main goal of upstreaming this PR is to set up the infrastructure for optimization passes of CPython uops. With constant propagation, turning global loads or attribute loads to constants at the region formation phase will open up further optimizations in subsequent passes. This PR also makes CPython uops ready for type propagation, thus allowing wide-scale typed operations.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- An automatically generated abstract interpreter from the interpreter DSL.\r\n- Abstract interpretation of uops.\r\n- ~~Partitioning of values on the stack and locals into static/dynamic using the concept of \"partitions of nodes\".~~\r\n- ~~Introduces the concept of \"pure\" operations, and what can be ascertained about them.~~\r\n- ~~Constant propagation purely via abstract interpretation of bytecode, with no requirement for SSA or AST.~~\r\n- ~~An optimization pass to remove redundant `SAVE_IP`s after partial evaluation.~~\r\n- ~~Jump target/instruction numbering, which allows us to freely relocate jump targets/instructions, as a final pass will fix them up.~~\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nWe have the following test case.\r\n```\r\n        def testfunc(loops):\r\n            num = 0\r\n            while num < loops:\r\n                x = 0\r\n                y = 1\r\n                z = 2\r\n                a = x + y + z + x + y + z + x + y + z\r\n                num += 1\r\n            return a\r\n```\r\nThis is now essentially simplified down to:\r\n```\r\n        def testfunc(loops):\r\n            num = 0\r\n            while num < loops:\r\n                x = 0\r\n                y = 1\r\n                z = 2\r\n                a = 9\r\n                num += 1\r\n            return a\r\n```\r\nWhich roughly halves the trace length.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Use `lltrace` convention commonly seen in rest of the uops codebase.\r\n- [x] Cleanup.\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-107557 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-107557\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

This always puts the desired callable at the same location on the stack, simplifying (or removing) the resulting shuffles and adjustments necessary for the shared code paths that follow.\r\n\r\nThis also changes `CALL_FUNCTION_EX`, `DICT_MERGE`, `LOAD_ATTR`, `LOAD_GLOBAL`, `LOAD_SUPER_ATTR` to support the new stack layout. In some cases, I've also changed the names of the stack items for consistency within a family.\r\n\r\nAs a side-effect of the new layout, `LOAD_ATTR_PROPERTY` and `LOAD_ATTR_GETATTRIBUTE_OVERRIDDEN` (which are both implemented as inlined calls) don't support pushing an additional item to the stack for a following `CALL` (`oparg & 1`) anymore. I think this is fine, since it seems rare to call a \"method\" that's looked up in this manner.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-105848 -->\n* Issue: gh-105848\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

I have my research for the `.python_history` compatibility problem. I will write comments within days.\r\n\r\nMy commit allows a tab complete in pdb and cmd for Libedit readline and improves compatibility between GNU readline and Libedit.\r\n\r\nFor better compatibility, Python Documents should suggest using backslashed escape sequences(e.g. `\\t`, `\\a`) or the ASCII character corresponding to the octal number(or octal excape sequences).(e.g. `\\011`,  It's because the only thing GNU readline(`man bash` and `/Readline Key Bindings` to search the part.) and Libedit(`man editrc`) have in common. \r\n\r\n`tab` of `readline.parse_and_bind(\"tab: complete\")` is a symbolic character name. Libedit doesn't support a number of symbolic character names(like TAB, ESC, DEL). \r\n\r\nAlso, unlike emacs keybinding,  GNU readline doesn't support control characters of the form '^character' (e.g. '^I' it's a tab). \r\nBoth GNU readline and Libedit support the following backslashed escape sequences.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\a     bell\r\n\\b     backspace\r\n\\f     form feed\r\n\\n     newline\r\n\\r     carriage return\r\n\\t     horizontal tab\r\n\\v     vertical tab\r\n\\nnn   octal escape sequences\r\n```\r\nGNU readline's predefined commands are in the '/Readline Command Names' of `man bash`.\r\nLibedit's predefined commands are in the section \"EDITOR COMMANDS\" of `man editrc`. But there are other undocumented commands in its source code.\r\nOr you can get a list by `import readline; readline.parse_and_bind('bind -l')` (Libedit only).\r\n\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-102130 -->\n* Issue: gh-102130\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n\r\n\r\n<!-- readthedocs-preview cpython-previews start -->\r\n----\n:books: Documentation preview :books:: https://cpython-previews--107738.org.readthedocs.build/\n\r\n<!-- readthedocs-preview cpython-previews end -->",

While class names do not ordinarily contain special characters, it is possible to encounter these when a class is created dynamically. Escaping the name will correctly return `None` in this scenario, rather than potentially matching a different class or raising `re.error` depending on the symbols used.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-107715 -->\n* Issue: gh-107715\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

        "body": "Several of the `__repr__` functions in `Tools/clinic/` have no test coverage at the moment, so this PR started life as an attempt to get some easy coverage improvements. While working on adding coverage for the `__repr__` functions, however, I noticed that the reprs for classes in `Tools/clinic/` can be pretty inconsistent -- e.g. `Function` objects describe themselves as `clinic.Function` objects in their reprs, but `Destination` objects just describe themselves as `Destination` objects. Some classes quoted their `self.name` attribute in their `__repr__` methods; others didn't. This PR therefore also improves the consistency of the `__repr__` methods in `Tools/clinic/`.\r\n\r\nCoverage prior to this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                     Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nTools\\clinic\\clinic.py    2947    135   1236    114    94%\r\nTools\\clinic\\cpp.py        102      9     54      2    90%\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nTOTAL                     3049    144   1290    116    94%\r\n```\r\n\r\nCoverage with this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                     Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nTools\\clinic\\clinic.py    2948    119   1236    115    94%\r\nTools\\clinic\\cpp.py        103      8     54      2    91%\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nTOTAL                     3051    127   1290    117    94%\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, no change to the top-line stat, but a reasonable reduction in uncovered statements.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-104683 -->\n* Issue: gh-104683\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

        "body": "Many `state_foo` methods on the `DSLParser` class in `clinic.py` are called only indirectly via the `next()` method:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/blob/407d7fda94268d70b92e2e685ca9891ec3641e78/Tools/clinic/clinic.py#L4645-L4652\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the `DSLParser` parses argument-clinic input a line at a time; but `state` often persists across lines. (Example: a docstring can span multiple lines; by saving the \"state\" at the end of one line, the DSLParser is able to resume parsing with the same state when it begins parsing the next line, and therefore knows that it's in the middle of a docstring.)\r\n\r\nHowever, there are two `state_foo` methods on the `DSLParser` class that are arguably badly named, and _shouldn't_ be called via `self.next()`, even though they both currently are:\r\n- `state_modulename_name`\r\n- `state_parameter_docstring_start`\r\n\r\nBoth of these are examples of states that are impossible to span multiple lines. A modulename declaration _cannot_ span multiple lines; nor can the _start_ of a parameter docstring. As such, calling these methods via `self.next()` is needless indirection, and can be removed.\r\n\r\nIt is provable that both of these states cannot span multiple lines, due to the fact that neither `state_modulename_name` nor `state_parameter_docstring_start` ever exit early before setting `self.state` to something new (by calling `self.next`).\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-104683 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-104683\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

But since `state_terminal` is special (it's the only one of the `state_foo` methods that expects to be passed `None`, and it's only ever called once, after the entire block has been parsed), we can just... special-case it. If we rename it to `do_post_block_processing_cleanup()`, and call it explicitly after parsing the block rather than indirectly via `next()`, this allows us to greatly simplify the typing across the rest of the `DSLParser` `state_foo` methods, and makes the code generally much more readable for humans as well.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-104683 -->\n* Issue: gh-104683\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

An approach that works just as well, and makes mypy much more happy, is to delay setting `self.function` at all until after `converter_init()` has run. We can improve the error message if somebody _does_ try to access `self.function` inside a `converter_init()` method by adding a `__getattr__` method that catches the resulting `AttributeError` and adds to the error message the line number in the `clinic` input that caused `clinic` to fail.\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-104683 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-104683\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

        "body": "This should fix almost all cases of the new C recursion limit preventing code that worked for 3.11 working for 3.12.\r\n\r\nThe original recursion limit of 1000 was to protect the C stack and to provide a meaningful error in case of runaway recursion.\r\nSince calls to Python functions no longer consume C stack, protection of the C stack is independent of the depth of the Python stack. So we decoupled the two operations. The default Python recursion limit is unchanged at 1000 and can be modified by `sys.setrecursionlimit()`. However, the C recursion limit is set to 800, as the limit of 1000 was too large for some platforms, especially debug builds.\r\n\r\nHistorically it has been `_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()` that consumes the most stack space, so that sets the (quite low) limit of 800 for C recursion. \r\nWe can allow deeper recursion of C code and preserve safety by increasing the C recursion counting a call to `_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()` as several normal calls.\r\n\r\nThis PR raises the C recursion limit from 800 to  ~2500~1500 and counts each call to `_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()` as ~three~ two normal calls.\r\n\r\nIf this is deemed insufficient, we could expose the means to modify the C recursion limit, but that might be too large a change for 3.12.\r\n\r\n@Yhg1s\r\n@gpshead\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-107263 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-107263\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

Passing `clinic` as a parameter to `warn_or_fail` would mean that every usage of `warn()` or `fail()` would have to be updated, which would have led to a huge diff.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d0dcd27d3a8b8680803510fee59836cd732feb7a/Tools/clinic/clinic.py#L155-L171\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this PR still feels like a (small) improvement over the current state of affairs. In particular, by passing `clinic` as a parameter to `output_templates`, we remove the need for an `assert clinic is not None` assertion. This PR also reduces the changes that will be required in the future, should we want to move `output_templates` into a separate module...\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-104683 -->\n* Issue: gh-104683\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

The crash happened due the combination of the \"detached\" thread state we were using and the \"last holder\" logic we use for the GIL.  It turns out it's tricky to use the same thread state for different threads.  Who could have guessed?\r\n\r\nWe solve the problem by eliminating the one object we were still sharing between interpreters.  We replace it with a low-level hashtable, using the \"raw\" allocator to avoid tying it to the main interpreter.\r\n\r\nWe also remove the accommodations for \"detached\" thread states, which were a dubious idea to start with.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 8ba4df91ae60833723d8d3b9afeb2b642f7176d5)\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-105699 -->\n* Issue: gh-105699\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

This can often lead to bugs slipping beneath the radar.\r\n\r\nIn the case of argument clinic, the check only flags a single function. _But_, turns out that it's a true positive!

        "body": "We tried this before with a dict and for all interned strings.  That ran into problems due to interpreter isolation.  However, exclusively using a per-interpreter cache caused some inconsistency that can eliminate the benefit of interning.  Here we circle back to using a global cache, but only for statically allocated strings.  We also use a more-basic _Py_hashtable_t for that global cache instead of a dict.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would only have the global cache, but the optional isolation of each interpreter's allocator means that a non-static string object must not outlive its interpreter.  Thus we would have to store a copy of each such interned string in the global cache, tied to the main interpreter.\n(cherry picked from commit b72947a8d26915156323ccfd04d273199ecb870c)\n\nCo-authored-by: Eric Snow <ericsnowcurrently@gmail.com>\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-106931 -->\n* Issue: gh-106931\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

I noticed this when looking at the output of the build after commit fabcbe9c12688eb9a902a5c89cb720ed373625c5 was merged, and the following 2 commits (6a43cce32b66e0f66992119dd82959069b6f324a and 2b1a81e2cfa740609d48ad82627ae251262e6470) also failed with the same error.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, not all platforms seem to fail because of this omission. In commit 2b1a81e2cfa740609d48ad82627ae251262e6470, for example:\r\n- [AMD64 RHEL7 3.x](https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/15/builds/5219) DOES NOT compile\r\n- [AMD64 Debian PGO 3.x](https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/249/builds/5842) DOES compile\r\n\r\nThis seems a odd to me, but I'm not familiar enough with the CI/build process to offer a suggestion for this discrepancy between platforms.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-107279 -->\n* Issue: gh-107279\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

However, exclusively using a per-interpreter cache caused some inconsistency that can eliminate the benefit of interning.

We also use a more-basic `_Py_hashtable_t` for that global cache instead of a dict.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would only have the global cache, but the optional isolation of each interpreter's allocator means that a non-static string object must not outlive its interpreter.  Thus we would have to store a *copy* of each such interned string in the global cache, tied to the main interpreter.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-106931 -->\n* Issue: gh-106931\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

        "body": "`Shelf` inherits its `clear` method from `MutableMapping`, but the implementation is poorly suited for that class. The `clear` mix-in is implemented by calling `popitem` in a loop. Each call to `popitem` constructs a new iterator over the shelf, which is a generator that does byte-to-str conversion on the keys in the `dbm` object. Unfortunately, `dbm` objects are non-iterable, and their `keys` method simply returns a list of all keys. Since each `popitem` call performs a full scan of the key space, the clear method ends up having O(n\u00b2) performance (assuming the delete and read operations amortize to O(1)).\r\n\r\nBy having the shelf just iterate over the list of dbm keys once, this is avoided.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-107089 -->\n* Issue: gh-107089\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

It checked that `cls->tp_getattro == PyObject_GetGenericAttr` (as a precondition for attempting the load-method optimization), but what we really need to know is that `Py_TYPE(self)->tp_getattro == PyObject_GenericGetAttr`. In the typical case of `super(MyClass, instance)...` these are effectively the same thing (`instance` will be an instance of `MyClass`), but in a classmethod super() call (`super(MyClass, MyClass)...`) they are quite different; the type of `MyClass` is `type`, which has a different `tp_getattro`.\r\n\r\nFor actual classmethods this was fine; the load-method optimization still works correctly for classmethods looked up on types. But it doesn't work for regular methods (plain function objects) looked up on types; those are just regular function calls with no bound method behavior.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty unusual to use classmethod-style `super` where the call target is a regular function, not a classmethod. But it can occur, e.g. if using `super` with `__new__` and dynamically-assigned `__new__` methods, as in #106917.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-106917 -->\n* Issue: gh-106917\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

It turns out it's tricky to use the same thread state for different threads.

We replace it with a low-level hashtable, using the \"raw\" allocator to avoid tying it to the main interpreter.\r\n\r\nWe also remove the accommodations for \"detached\" thread states, which were a dubious idea to start with.\r\n\r\n(This approach does not have the same potential performance penalty as the linked list we used in gh-106899.)\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-105699 -->\n* Issue: gh-105699\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

That needs to be addressed separately from fixing the crasher.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-105699 -->\n* Issue: gh-105699\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

This new function is then used in `os__path_normpath_impl` to pass the above mentioned length into `PyUnicode_FromWideChar` instead of -1.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this adds a test to check that normpath is not truncating paths containing a null character as well as changes `test_addpackage_import_bad_pth_file` in `test_site.py` which was using a null character to make a bad path, specifically it was using the string `'abc\\x00def'`. The problem is that before this change this was being truncated for parts of the test so the string it was actually using in those parts was `'abc'`. Upon making the normpath changes it started throwing the error `ValueError: embedded null character` so I changed the test to use `'abc<>$$**:://def'` instead.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-106242 -->\n* Issue: gh-106242\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

If they're improved by a PR, the CI will [fail to make sure the ratio constants are updated](https://github.com/pygments/pygments/blob/14cff613a681d2c95bf2c56f81833f645353bbe0/tests/contrast/test_contrasts.py#L97-L100), to ensure continual improvement with no regressions.\r\n\r\nThis is a good idea!\r\n\r\nLet's add it here, to check if any files in `.nitignore` (which may have Sphinx warnings) switch to having no warnings. Then we can remove them from `.nitignore` to make sure they remain free of warnings.\r\n\r\nI was going to add another Sphinx build, a fourth, to touch the relevant files, so only those would be rebuilt. But four builds is far too many!\r\n\r\nInstead, let's build only once and save the warnings to a file. Then we can process the file and do the three phases:\r\n\r\n* Annotate PRs with Sphinx nitpicks (as before)\r\n* Ensure some files always pass Sphinx nit-picky mode (as before)\r\n* Check for improved files that can be removed from `.nitignore` (new!)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- readthedocs-preview cpython-previews start -->\r\n----\n:books: Documentation preview :books:: https://cpython-previews--106460.org.readthedocs.build/\n\r\n<!-- readthedocs-preview cpython-previews end -->\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-101100 -->\n* Issue: gh-101100\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

        "body": "When locking was removed from `functools.cached_property` in https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/101890, the `__get__` method also stopped pre-checking the instance dictionary for a cached value.\r\n\r\nThis removed pre-check is not necessary for the correct behavior of `cached_property` in and of itself: since it's a non-data descriptor (does not define `__set__` or `__delete__`), the instance dictionary takes precedence over `__get__`, so `__get__` should never be reached if a cached value is set in the instance dictionary.\r\n\r\nBut it seems that some users (including at least one popular library; see issue for details) are subclassing `cached_property` and adding a `__set__` method, turning it into a data descriptor, which takes precedence over the instance dictionary. Prior to 3.12, this still worked OK (did not recompute the value on every access) because of the additional check for cached value in `__get__`. But with 3.12 as it currently stands, this code would silently stop caching the value due to the added `__set__` method.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's nice and clever for `cached_property` to be maximally efficient by taking advantage of being a non-data descriptor, I think in this case backwards-compatibility and avoiding a footgun is more important. Clearly some people are subclassing `cached_property` and adding `__set__` methods, and it's not realistic to expect every Python user to understand the subtleties of data vs non-data descriptors and how this could break `cached_property`. The cost here is also minimal: just one dictionary lookup, that should only occur once per instance (not on repeated access of the cached property).\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-106292 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-106292\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

In the latter case, restore the implementation deleted in #31458\r\n- Implement `_PathBase.resolve()` using `absolute()` and `readlink()`\r\n- Implement `_PathBase._scandir()` using `iterdir()`\r\n\r\nIn `test_pathlib.py`:\r\n\r\n- Add `PathBaseTest` to exercise the `_PathBase` class directly\r\n- Split `PathTest` into `DummyPathTest` and `PathTest`. The former exercises a representative subclass of `_PathBase`.\r\n- Add `DummyPathWithSymlinksTest` to exercise a similar subclass, this time with symlink support.\r\n\r\n## Questionable bits\r\n\r\nIn `pathlib.py`, the `_PathBase.is_junction()` and `_PathBase.resolve()` methods are new code. The latter is very performance-sensitive and may need more work.\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\n- Make `pathlib._PathBase` public. There's still at least a couple of things to do first:\r\n  - ~~Make `PurePath._flavour` public~~\r\n  - Figure out what to do with `_PathBase.__hash__()`, `__eq__()`, and other comparison methods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-89812 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-89812\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

        "body": "In order to bridge between the C-only function watchers API and the func watcher tests written in Python, the support code in testcapimodule maintains a mapping between an array of up to two test func watchers (indices 0 and 1) and the real func watcher IDs (returned by `PyFunction_AddWatcher`) corresponding to those test watcher indices.\r\n\r\n`add_func_watcher` and `clear_func_watcher` in testcapimodule disagreed about which of those ids should be exposed to the Python test code. `add_func_watcher` returned the \"test watcher index\" (always 0 or 1), but `clear_func_watcher` expected the real watcher ID.\r\n\r\nWhen the tests are run with no other func watchers active, this confusion doesn't matter, because the ids will always match up exactly; test watchers 0 and 1 will always have the real watcher IDs 0 and 1. But if the tests are run with another func watcher active (e.g. from a third-party JIT), the IDs will no longer match up (test watchers 0 and 1 will have real watcher IDs 1 and 2), and this breaks some tests.\r\n\r\nFix `add_func_watcher` so that we always expose real watcher IDs (not test watcher indices) to the Python tests.\r\n\r\n(It's necessary to make the fix in this direction because of `test_clear_unassigned_watcher_id`, which needs to pass an unassigned real watcher ID through to `PyFunction_ClearWatcher`.)\r\n\r\nAlso rename `NUM_FUNC_WATCHERS` to `NUM_TEST_FUNC_WATCHERS` to help clarify this distinction in the code, and update an error message to be clearer that there are no test watcher indices free; there may still be actual watcher slots free.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-91053 -->\n* Issue: gh-91053\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

        "body": "We've come across a concurrency bug in logging/__init__.py which involves the handling of asynchronous exceptions, such as KeyboardInterrupt, during the execution of logging._acquireLock().\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, when threading.RLock.acquire() is executed, there is a possibility for an asynchronous exception to occur during the transition back from native code, even if the lock acquisition is successful.\r\n\r\nThe typical use of _acquireLock() in the logging library is as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _loggingMethod(handler):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Add a handler to the internal cleanup list using a weak reference.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    _acquireLock()\r\n    try:\r\n        # doSomething\r\n    finally:\r\n        _releaseLock()\r\n```\r\nIn this pattern, if a KeyboardInterrupt is raised during the lock acquisition, the lock ends up getting abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhen can this happen? One example is during forks. logging/__init__.py registers an at-fork hook, with\r\n\r\n```python\r\nos.register_at_fork(before=_acquireLock,\r\n                    after_in_child=_after_at_fork_child_reinit_locks,\r\n                    after_in_parent=_releaseLock)\r\n```\r\nA scenario occurring in our production environment is during a slow fork operation (when the server is under heavy load and performing a multitude of forks). The lock could be held for up to a minute. If this is happening in a secondary thread, and a SIGINT signal is received in the main thread while is waiting to acquire the lock for logging, the lock will be abandoned. This will causes the process to hang during the next _acquireLock() call.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we provide a simple pull request to add a try-except block within _acquireLock(), e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _acquireLock():\r\n    if _lock:\r\n        try:\r\n            _lock.acquire()\r\n        except BaseException:\r\n            _lock.release()\r\n            raise\r\n```\r\nThis way, if an exception arises during the lock acquisition, the lock will be released, preventing the lock from being abandoned and the process from potentially hanging.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for your contribution!\r\nPlease read this comment in its entirety.

However, the js-promise-integration proposal requires the [type reflection for Wasm/JS API](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-types) proposal, which allows us to actually count the number of arguments a function expects.\r\n\r\nFor better compatibility with stack switching, this PR checks if type reflection is available, and if so we use a switch block to decide the appropriate signature. If type reflection is unavailable, we should use the current EMJS trampoline.\r\n\r\nWe cache the function argument counts since when I didn't cache them performance was negatively affected.\r\n\r\nA backport of this patch to v3.11.x is tested against Pyodide and passes our tests:\r\nhttps://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3964\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-106213 -->\n* Issue: gh-106213\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n",

However, user subclasses automatically inherit an `__fspath__()` method, which may not be appropriate. For example, a user subclass may implement a \"virtual\" filesystem to provide access to a `.zip` file or FTP server. But it would be highly surprising if `open(FTPPath(...))` attempted to open a *local* file.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes the `os.PathLike` interface opt-in for `pathlib.PurePath` subclasses. In pathlib itself, we opt into the `os.PathLike` interface for `PurePosixPath`, `PureWindowsPath` and `Path`. As `PurePath` is not instantiable (you always get a `PurePosixPath` or `PureWindowsPath` object back), this is backwards compatible with 3.11.\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-106037 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-106037\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",

It doesn't even mention Django nor Flask. It's so dead it's not linked directly, it's linked through webarchive.org \r\n* 2nd commit: nobody mainstream does web using CGI anymore, for years. This has become a very corner case that does not belong in the FAQ\r\n* 3rd commit: I haven't seen a serial port on a computer for at least 12 years. Same thing than above, of course there must be people on earth who still uses this but it does not belong in the FAQ\r\n\r\nIn a general matter, I think we should remove links preserved through archive.org.

To make this PR easy to review, no other changes have been made to those sections (they've just been moved from one document to the other).\r\n\r\nThe consensus in #91533 was that we'd prefer to have HOWTOs hosted at https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ rather than at docs.python.org. However, we've now had over a year with next to no progress made on that front. I personally have found the idea of starting work on https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ pretty overwhelming, as you'd be starting basically from scratch -- there's very little documentation there at all currently. Working within the CPython repo, I can work incrementally, which makes it _far_ more likely that improvements will be made. And I think we probably all agree that making improvements to the documentation is a more important thing to focus on than arguing about where exactly specific bits of the documentation should be hosted.\n\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-91533 -->\n* Issue: gh-91533\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\n\r\n\r\n<!-- readthedocs-preview cpython-previews start -->\r\n----\n:books: Documentation preview :books:: https://cpython-previews--105827.org.readthedocs.build/\n\r\n<!-- readthedocs-preview cpython-previews end -->",

        "body": "With comprehension inlining (PEP 709), comprehension iteration variables in class- and module-scoped comprehensions are now stored as \"hidden\" fast-locals (in scopes that otherwise use dictionary locals, not fast locals.) This maintains good isolation, but it also has the side effect that calling `locals()` (or `vars()`) inside a class- or module-scoped comprehension does not include the comprehension iteration var. It can't in the naive way (just updating the frame's locals dict, as done in `_PyFrame_FastToLocals`) because that could overwrite a key of the same name from the outer class/module scope, breaking isolation. But there are existing use cases where having visibility of the name in `locals()` matters, e.g. `prefixed_names = [\"foo{name}\".format(**locals()) for name in names]`.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the comprehension iteration var visible in `locals()` within class- and module-scope comprehensions again, by creating and returning a new dictionary for calls to `locals()` (when there are hidden fast-locals) which is a copy of the outer locals, plus the extra hidden local(s) added.\r\n\r\nThis would be a very localized change encapsulated within `PyEval_GetLocals` and the frame functions it calls, except for the unfortunate detail that `PyEval_GetLocals` currently returns a borrowed reference to the singular locals dict cached on the frame, and so it simply can't ever return a new locals dictionary. And it's public API, so it has to keep returning a borrowed reference. So this PR introduces `PyEval_GetFrameLocals`, which is instead defined to return a new reference, and uses it in `locals()`, `vars()`, `dir()`, `exec()` and `eval()` (all the locations where `PyEval_GetLocals` was used internally.) Long term, returning a new reference is definitely preferable (as is almost always the case): it means the caller doesn't have to worry about the frame's lifetime, it doesn't require caching locals dicts on frames (leading to cyclic references), and it gives more internal implementation flexibility.\r\n\r\nIn the 3.13 cycle I'd like to move PEP 667 forward, which would bring a more comprehensive consistency to the behavior of `locals()` in all kinds of namespaces. With PEP 667, `_PyFrame_FastToLocals` would disappear entirely, and this fix would just naturally fall out of the behavior of `locals()` as returning a mapping object that is a consistent view on the current locals namespace. PEP 667 also explicitly deprecates the borrowed-reference-returning `PyEval_GetLocals` et al and replaces them with new-reference-returning forms. I chose the name `PyEval_GetFrameLocals` in this PR so as to maximize compatibility with a possible PEP 667 future.\r\n\r\n<!-- gh-issue-number: gh-105340 -->\r\n* Issue: gh-105340\r\n<!-- /gh-issue-number -->\r\n",
