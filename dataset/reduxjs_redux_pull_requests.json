What I was suggesting was not about increasing the number of variables, it was about reordering some lines of code, so the important ones, the ones you'd need to read first are on top. The variables was just something else I did in addition to the idea, in addition to using default parameters, for instance. I don't mind if this gets cut off as well. I believe this idea was misunderstood and deserves a fair second chance. And if the contributors think that's not the case, I'd like to learn why, perhaps I can learn something from this.\r\n\r\nIt always feels nice to contribute to a big project, even in a small way.\r\n",

Neither of these are a safe assumption:\r\n\r\n- `next` would be typed to have **all** of the dispatch extensions, including the ones earlier in the chain that would no longer apply.\r\n  - Technically it would be *mostly* safe to type `next` as the default Dispatch implemented by the base redux store, however this would cause `next(action)` to error (as we cannot promise `action` is actually an `Action`) - and it wouldn't account for any following middlewares that return anything other than the action they're given when they see a specific action.\r\n- `action` is not necessarily a known action, it can be literally anything - for example a thunk would be a function with no .type property (so `AnyAction` would be inaccurate)\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `next` to be `(action: unknown) => unknown` (which is accurate, we have no idea what `next` expects or will return), and changes the `action` parameter to be `unknown` (which as above, is accurate)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you added an explanation of what your changes do and why you'd like us to include them?\r\n- [x] Is there an existing issue for this PR?\r\n  - fixes #4518\r\n- [x] Have the files been linted and formatted?\r\n- [ ] Have the docs been updated to match the changes in the PR? (TODO)\r\n- [x] Have the tests been updated to match the changes in the PR?\r\n- [x] Have you run the tests locally to confirm they pass?\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n### What is the current behavior, and the steps to reproduce the issue?\r\nAs stated above, the types used for `next` and `action` are inaccurate at best, and dangerous at worst.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\nMiddleware should be forced to check what the action is, before using it.\r\n\r\n### How does this PR fix the problem?\r\nTypes `next` and `action` in a way that would force the middleware to type check before using them (`return next(action)` still works without issue)\r\n\r\n**Note: this is a breaking change for middleware typed to expect a certain action or dispatch for next. For example:** \r\n```ts\r\n// @ts-expect-error wrong next\r\nconst customMiddleware: Middleware = (api) => (next: Dispatch) => (action) => next(action);\r\n\r\n// @ts-expect-error wrong action\r\nconst promiseMiddleware: Middleware<{\r\n  (promise: Promise<any>): Promise<void>\r\n}> = (api) => (next) => (action: Promise) => {\r\n  if (action instanceof Promise) {\r\n    return promise.then(console.log);\r\n  }\r\n  return next(action);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, I would argue this is a good change - as explained above, this is inherently a lie to the compiler, and is thus unsafe.\r\n\r\nSimilar to [caught errors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4/#use-unknown-catch-variables), any middleware that (unsafely) wishes to opt out and treat `action` as `any` can still do so:\r\n```ts\r\nconst customMiddleware: Middleware = (api) => (next) => (action: any) => next(action);\r\n```",

        "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThe main change to pay attention to here is the update to the `Reducer` type. Before this PR `Reducer` has a type of:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Reducer<S, A extends Action> = (\r\n  state: S | undefined,\r\n  action: A\r\n) => S\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR `Reducer` has this type:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Reducer<S, A extends Action, PreloadedState = S> = (\r\n  state: S | PreloadedState | undefined,\r\n  action: A\r\n) => S\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n\r\nWhy the need for this change? When the store is first created by `createStore`, the initial state is set to whatever is passed as the `preloadedState` argument (or `undefined` if nothing is passed). That means that the first time that the reducer is called, it is called with the `preloadedState`. After the first call, the reducer is always passed the current state (which is `S`).\r\n\r\nFor most normal reducers, `S | undefined` accurately describes what can be passed in for the `preloadedState`. However the `combineReducers` function allows for a preloaded state of `Partial<S> | undefined`.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to have a separate generic that represents what the reducer accepts for its preloaded state. That way `createStore` can then use that generic for its `preloadedState` argument.\r\n\r\n### Previous work\r\n\r\nUp until now, this has been accounted for with the `$CombinedState` type which is a way to \"mark\" a type as returned by `combineReducers`. The `PreloadedState` type then looks to see if the type has that \"mark\" and then accepts `Partial<S>` if it has that \"mark.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the problems this can cause is that if there are multiple copies of Redux in `node_modules`, then the \"mark\" for one copy of Redux is different than the \"mark\" for the other copy, and therefore they won't recognize each other.\r\n\r\nThis also seems to be causing some problems in https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/2068.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the need for `$CombinedState` altogether.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Impact\r\n\r\nThis change does include some breaking changes, but overall should not have a huge impact on users upgrading in user-land.\r\n\r\n### Additional generic arguments\r\n\r\nThe `Reducer`, `ReducersMapObject`, and `createStore` types/function take an additional `PreloadedState` generic which defaults to `S`.\r\n\r\n### `combineReducers`\r\n\r\nThe overloads for `combineReducers` are removed in favor of a single function definition that takes the `ReducersMabObject` as its generic parameter. Removing the overloads was necessary with these changes, since sometimes it was choosing the wrong overload.\r\n\r\n### Enhancers\r\n\r\nEnhancers that explicitly list the generics for the reducer will need to add the third generic.",

The fact that Rollup can [accept an array of `RegExp`s as `external`](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/v2.70.0/src/rollup/types.d.ts#L528) has made this a lot more straightforward.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you added an explanation of what your changes do and why you'd like us to include them?\r\n- [x] Is there an existing issue for this PR?\r\n- [x] Have the files been linted and formatted?\r\n- [x] Have the docs been updated to match the changes in the PR?\r\n- [x] Have the tests been updated to match the changes in the PR?\r\n- [x] Have you run the tests locally to confirm they pass?",

In contrast, the existing examples assume the audience understands the lifecycle methods of class components. Both of these concepts are foundational to modern React development. Still, functions and hooks seem to be the preferred method of defining a component (e.g., the React docs have mainly been rewritten to use functional components: https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html).\r\n",

As in, I just got done writing for the last few hours :)~~\r\n\r\n~~So far I've got a \"Part 7: RTKQ Basics\" page written up, as seen here.  I plan to add a \"Part 8: RTKQ Advanced Patterns\" page covering the rest of the example commits (page name TBD).~~ \r\n\r\n~~I've just added the \"Advanced\" page first draft to go along with the \"Basics\" page.~~\r\n\r\n~~I've also got a third draft of the planned example app code completed, and have just pushed that up to https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-essentials-example-app/tree/tutorial-steps-2021-08-14.~~\r\n\r\n~~I also will need to go through and do some more cleanup of the earlier sections of the Essentials tutorial, applying some of the feedback from existing issues.~~\r\n\r\nI've got the content basically complete at this point. New pages should be done. Fixed up the existing pages to match the latest code and fill in some missing explanations, and addressed the review comments.\r\n\r\nOnly thing that should be left at this point is updating the example repo with the final code in the `tutorial-steps` branch, adding the right tags, and filling in the Sandboxes for the new pages.\r\n\r\nThe nearly-final example code is viewable at https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-essentials-example-app/tree/tutorial-steps-2021-08-28 .\r\n\r\nThe new content is previewable at https://deploy-preview-4153--redux-docs.netlify.app/tutorials/essentials/part-7-rtk-query-basics .",

So I arrived upon this solution which should not affect further composition above the middleware.\r\n",

So any usage of a `type` that internally uses `$CombinedState` means the resulting declaration must also use `$CombinedState`. Since that value is not exported, Typescript fails.\r\n\r\nUsing an interface however does not need direct access to `$CombinedState`, so the exporting of `combineReducers` will magically succeed.\r\n",

        "body": "Hi, while I was preparing a Japanese translation of the Redux docs using the fork-based approach, I noticed that Netlify refuses to rebuild and deploy the forked site even after I pushed some translated docs under `/docs`. The deploy log says:\r\n\r\n```\r\n12:27:22 PM: No changes detected in base directory. Returning early from build.\r\n12:27:22 PM: Failed during stage 'checking build content for changes': Canceled build due to no content change\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is due to [the change Netlify made in October 2019](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#ignore-builds):\r\n\r\n> For sites connected to a Git repo after October 3rd, 2019, Netlify tries to determine if there are any changes in the site's base directory by comparing the last known version of the files within that directory. If no change was detected, the build system skips the build, returning early from the build process.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem. It adds the `ignore` attribute in `netlify.toml` so that the site will be rebuilt on _every_ push even when the contents of the `/website` directory have not changed. (This uses `/bin/false`, a UNIX command that just exits with the status code `1`.)\r\n\r\nAccording to the Netlify docs, this doesn't affect how Netlify builds the original docs site (redux.js.org), but it helps new forks in the future.",

I've got the first half of page 3 (\"State, Reducers, and Actions\") thrown together, although I haven't worked on the actual example app at all yet.  I'll need to take time to do that shortly.\r\n\r\nHappily, I've got a pretty good picture of how I want to tackle this app and explanation now.  I also will be able to reuse some of the explanations from the existing \"Basics\" tutorial, and I _intend_ to keep this shorter than the \"Essentials\" tutorial.  So, I'm hoping I'll be able to complete this one somewhat faster than the six months it took me to put the \"Essentials\" tutorial together :)",

Branded types (e.g. `string &  { _brand: \"a\" }`) now resolve to `never` in `PreloadedState`. This PR fixes #3672 for newer TS versions.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR targets the 4.x branch, since we're using 4.0.5 today. If this PR is accepted I'll PR master with the same fix as well.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n### What is the current behavior, and the steps to reproduce the issue?\r\nBranded strings cannot be passed to `createStore` as part of the preloaded state:\r\n```typescript\r\ntype BrandedString = string & { _brand: \"a\" };\r\ninterface IState {\r\n    version: BrandedString;\r\n}\r\nconst initialState: IState = {\r\n    version: \"1.0.0\" as BrandedString,\r\n};\r\ncreateStore(\u2026reducer\u2026, initialState);\r\n```\r\nThe error on `initialState` in the last line:\r\n```\r\nNo overload matches this call.\r\n  Overload 1 of 2, '(reducer: Reducer<IState, Action<any>>, enhancer?: StoreEnhancer<unknown, unknown> | undefined): Store<IState, Action<any>>', gave the following error.\r\n    Argument of type 'IState' is not assignable to parameter of type 'StoreEnhancer<unknown, unknown>'.\r\n      Type 'IState' provides no match for the signature '(next: StoreEnhancerStoreCreator<{}, {}>): StoreEnhancerStoreCreator<unknown, unknown>'.\r\n  Overload 2 of 2, '(reducer: Reducer<IState, Action<any>>, preloadedState?: { version: never; } | undefined, enhancer?: StoreEnhancer<unknown, {}> | undefined): Store<...>', gave the following error.\r\n    Argument of type 'IState' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ version: never; }'.\r\n      Types of property 'version' are incompatible.\r\n        Type 'BrandedString' is not assignable to type 'never'.ts(2769)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgYygUwIYzQZRtNOAXzgDMoIQ4AidAEwFcAPagbgCh2YBPMQgISgYAdnTR08UYMIDmcALxwAzjCmy4AMkRwA+gCMhogFw0M1Yh2nYopDMkIBJPFkIJ2cD3ABuaKEuAQwiaCImISqtIyHETsyIEqcNLAMMAYADbO2CZOMC4KiO6ePn4BQTQADAB0VeXmGEpwIaLikpEANOxEHKiY2HgEABQDKi7ZmYQAPnAMzaTS4gCUCgB8cAMIJPVwItwLbYnCyakZudgLHEA), note that everything is fine for TS 3.5 but starts breaking at 3.6+.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\nThe code compiles.\r\n\r\n### How does this PR fix the problem?\r\nSimilar to the proposal in microsoft/TypeScript#35992 this PR changes the mapped object type to only apply for types that are not primitives, since branded primitives are _also_ objects, which is why the current code hits them. By reversing the condition we first exclude primitives and apply the mapped type to what's left: objects that aren't just a brand on a primitive.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the original suggestion in #3672 of allowing `PreloadedState<S> | S` should also work.\r\n\r\nI could also change this PR to be slightly safer by making both the primitive escape hatch and the object matching explicit, e.g. `{ [K in keyof S]: S[K] extends string ? S[K] : S[K] extends object ? PreloadedState<S[K]> : S[K] }`\r\n",

        "body": "My WIP example of testing strategies I'd propose showcasing in the redux docs for how to test a react app w/ container & integration tests style verification, as an alternative to RTL. \r\n\r\nRTL is great & should be recommended for users who are starting out, but there are strong merits to choosing Enzyme over RTL for some users / projects. A lot of the techniques Enzyme allows for are outlined in Micheal Feather's \"working effectively with legacy code\" book. The high isolation test patterns can also be useful for error localization & documentation purposes,  especially in more complex code bases, regardless of legacy code. Having high isolation tests does not preclude you from also having integration tests, and despite what some will say the \"testing pyramid\" is still a very valid concept for certain types of apps that aren't just CRUD apps (which also happens to be where Redux provides the most value).\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: Sometimes it is useful to have escape hatches to \"break the rules\", sometimes it is useful to have bumpers at the bowling alley to \"save\" you from a gutter ball. Both libraries have their own strong points, and allow for various & overlapping testing strategies.\r\n\r\nMy \"ask\" would be to make the docs unbiased & maintain official guidance for using both. I'll take my PR to Enzyme or make a blog post if its not wanted here ;) but Enzyme is an incredibly useful tool that has affordances RTL has taken a stance on not adding.\r\n",

It assumes that `next` will create a store with the current enhancers `Ext` and `StateExt` already applied to store. Instead, `next` returns a store with `NextExt` and `NextStateExt` generic parameters since the enhancer should work when composed with any other enhancer. It then expects the `StoreEnhancer` to return a new store creator that will create a store with `Ext` and `NextExt`, and `StateExt` and `NextStateExt`.\r\n\r\nNote that I had to remove the `ExtendState` type in order to make this work. This type was introduced in https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/pull/3524, but I wasn't able to get the types working while using `ExtendState`.

Still, it happens that TypeScript would fail to infer the proper generic type to `combineReducers` function. In my case, I'm doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface FooState {\u2026}\r\ninterface AppAction extends Redux.Action<string> {}\r\ninterface FooAction0 extends AppAction {\u2026}\r\ninterface FooAction1 extends AppAction {\u2026}\r\ntype FooActions = FooAction0 | FooAction1;\r\n\r\nfunction fooReducer(state: FooState, action: FooActions): FooState {\r\n  return state;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Type error:\r\n// Argument of type 'Reducer<CombinedState<{ fooReducer: FooState; }>, FooActions>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Reducer<CombinedState<{ fooReducer: FooState; }>, AnyAction>'.\r\ncombineReducers({ fooReducer: fooReducer });\r\n\r\n// works\r\ncombineReducers<{fooReducer: FooState}>({ fooReducer: fooReducer });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nI would expect TypeScript to infer a generic type automatically.\r\n\r\n### How does this PR fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIt removes explicit `any`s which appears to help TypeScript to infer a type. I'm not sure why though :man_shrugging: . Could this be a bug in TypeScript?\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the first generic type of `ReducersMapObject` is a state which is already `any` by default, and the second generic type is `A extends Action` which is `Action` by default and not `any`. So the fact that the second generic type is `any` confuses TS for some reason.",

As it stands right now, the first 2 things they see are broken code, which isn't immediately apparent from a quick skim. This seems likely to introduce some confusion.\r\n\r\n## What changes does this PR make to fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIt moves the correct example so it's the first thing on the page.

So far I've done:\r\n\r\n- Figured out how to use MDX with Docusaurus\r\n- Added reusable components for `<Note>` (including multiple styles based on the Cypress.io docs) and `<DetailedExplanation>`\r\n- Created an empty \"Quick Start\" page\r\n- Added some initial \"what is this and why would I use it?\" content\r\n- Added instructions on creating a project\r\n\r\nI got stuck with some yak shaving when I realized that using the `diff` highlighting format leaves the `+-` diff signs as copyable characters, and ideally I'd like them _not_ copied or selectable.  I tried playing with `user-select: none` and the `:first-letter` selector, but it's not quite doing what I want.\r\n\r\nPutting this up for ongoing feedback as we work through this.\r\n\r\n/cc @taniarascia , @bpas247\r\n\r\n",

I think that, if used, it would be more suited to having 'Barebones Tutorial' as a subcategory under 'Tutorials', with a single page then dedicated each to Actions, Reducers, Payloads, Action creators, and the Store, but wanted to check what thoughts were on that before I made that change.\r\n\r\nIt also might not be the style of thing that you want on the docs - I think the material is probably more naturally suited to a video-ish thing.

        "body": "I saw you discussing pulling in `ts-toolbelt` to rewrite the `compose` utility in https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/pull/3563 and asking for alternative solutions on Twitter. I don't think you need to pull in a utility library to do so this, and `ts-toolbelt`'s solution seemed more complex than necessary, utilizing a bunch of custom type-level helper utilities. So, I decided to take a shot at rewriting `compose` from scratch, using no external dependencies & avoiding `any` entirely. This is what I came up with.\r\n\r\nImportant notes:\r\n- There are no behavior changes other than a change to the generic type params used in various overloads. When explicitly providing generic params for overloads accepting multi-arg functions, you must now pass in a tuple of types for the generic instead of only the type. This is accomplished via the combination of `A extends unknown[]` & `(...args: A)`. This actually fixes a bug that was present before which (accidentally, I believe) restricted these multi-arg functions to take in arguments all of the same type, which isn't necessary. You can see the changes I'm talking about reflected in the updated test.\r\n\r\n- I did not change the actual logic in the implementation body of the function. We could rewrite it without `reduce` in a potentially more performant way, but I wanted to keep the changes in this PR restricted to how the types work so that it would be easier to review. Note: There are some changes in the implementation, but they are just related to type signatures. Also, we could use `Function` where I'm using `Fn` and `unknown[]` where I'm using `Parameters<typeof b>` if you don't like what I did with these. It would still work the same way.\r\n\r\n- I think what's in the PR now is an improvement and could be merged as is (after fixing the line passing `...chain` to `compose` that's currently causing the build to fail), but, while I kept the actual functionality/behavior the same in this PR, I think it's worth considering making some further changes beyond what's been done so far in order to simplify what's required to properly type this function. I'll add more info on this in a followup comment.\r\n",

Since this is an overloaded function, the `StoreCreator` interface that defines `createStore` is updated for both of the overloads. See the note below about the default value for `StateExt` and `Ext`.\r\n2. the `StoreEnhancer` type needs to re-define the first `createStore` parameter passed to it. It now uses, and thus requires the `StateExt` and `Ext`, otherwise it expects the returned store *not* to have these properties. The point of a store enhancer is to return the enhanced store from `createStore`. The only reason this didn't fail in the past was because we didn't pass the store enhancer extension values to `createStore`.\r\n3. The returned `Store` from `StoreEnhancer` needs to have the `StateExt` and `Ext` extensions passed to it to enable the fix in `replaceReducer`.\r\n\r\nOne other crucial note:\r\n\r\n~~By default, the `StateExt` is defined to be the initial state. Originally, the PR had `{}` as the default value for `StateExt`, but this will fail if the state is defined as an array, or any other non-object value. By using `S`, this allows the default case to work for all possible values of the state shape~~. `Ext` is defined as `{}` because the store definition mixed with `{}` cancels out the `{}`.\r\n\r\nI also added a test for store enhancer with `replaceReducer`, to verify correctness of the new typing, and a test for a non-object store value to the `store` test.\r\n\r\n_UPDATE:_\r\nIt turns out using `StateExt = S` causes `replaceReducer` to fail. Instead, I changed it to check the base type. If it extends an object, `{}` will be a no-op. Otherwise, we return the type `S`, which will be one of the primitive types. There is no easy way to guarantee the type won't interfere with `replaceReducer`, but the assumption I am making is that if someone's root reducer isn't returning an object, it probably isn't going to call `replaceReducer` either.",

This does not make sense, as the purpose of `replaceReducer` is to change the store state.\r\n\r\nHowever, typescript types are static, and replaceReducer changes the type at run-time.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, we either need to cast the existing store to the new store type, or transform the store.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, a simple solution is to modify the signature for `replaceReducer` to return the existing store, and this gives us the ability to typecast to the new reducer type in a graceful way.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the `combineReducers` test passes when converted to typescript with minimal changes.\r\n\r\nThis *may* also fix #3482",

The implementation of type checking varies slightly between different blog posts. I chose an approach that I consider reasonable. I'm open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\n### Misc.\r\n1.  I placed the new doc under the \"Advanced\" section. If there is a more appropriate place for this specific doc I'd be happy to move it as needed.\r\n\r\n2.

I think it's easier to see how different bundles are different now, when their definitions are way shorter at the bottom of the file. If you don't like it I may revert the change.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nShipping less code - by using @babel/runtime helpers we are able to deduplicate their code across all dependencies using them.\r\n\r\nQuick test on the size of `es/redux.js`. It's not perfect because I have not minified away dev-only warnings, but I didn't do that for both cases (pre-PR & post-PR) so I think that results are still comparable.\r\n\r\nUsing\r\n```sh\r\nnpx terser -cm --toplevel es/redux.js | gzip -c | wc -c\r\n```\r\nI got 2958 pre-PR & 2862 post-PR. This is nearly 100b reduction & this includes a rather lengthy reference to the imported module (`@babel/runtime/helpers/esm/objectSpread`) which costs approximately 25b, so in fact this change saves 100b+ (assuming ESM code can be inlined in user bundles thanks to module concatenation aka scope hoisting). \ud83d\udcb0 ",

It turns out translation function `t()` (provided by another library) is not a function, but it's a string.\r\n\r\nI've spent a lot of time to determine where the problem is and I've managed to find it out.\r\nThe following [example of high order component](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/docs/recipes/UsingImmutableJS.md#use-a-higher-order-component-to-convert-your-smart-components-immutablejs-props-to-your-dumb-components-javascript-props) contains `Object.entries` that works in the wrong way periodically.\r\n\r\nI have an object like this:\r\n```\r\nconst obj = {\r\n  prop1: 5,\r\n  prop2: \"hello, world!\",\r\n  prop3: null,\r\n  t: f(),\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe first call of `Object.entries(obj)` returns:\r\n```\r\n(4) [Array(2), Array(2), Array(2), Array(2)]\r\n> 0: (2) [\"prop1\", 5],\r\n> 1: (2) [\"prop2\", \"hello, world!\"],\r\n> 2: (2) [\"prop3\", null],\r\n> 3: (2) [\"t\", f]\r\n```\r\nEverything is fine, but after a while my react component renders itself again and there is a need to convert Immutable props to JS props, so there is the second call of `Object.entries` with the following result:\r\n```\r\n(2) [Array(2), Array(2)]\r\n> 0: (2) [\"prop3\", null],\r\n> 1: (2) [\"t\", \"t\"]\r\n```\r\nTranslation function `t()` now is a string and my app crashes.\r\n\r\nI've replaced `Object.entries` with `Object.keys(obj).map((key) => { return [key, obj[key]]; })` and now my app on my android works very well.\r\n\r\nMy device and browser configurations:\r\n\r\n**Android Version:** 5.1.1 LM47V\r\n**Chrome browser:** 65.0.3325.109\r\n\r\nIn this PR the bug is fixed and provided with a small refactor of HOC component.",

In a sense it builds on from the basics section, but on it's not really exploring a basic part of redux.\r\n- Could do with closing statement and links to further reading.\r\n- Should this new code be added to the example? Could be a useful addition, but then it would break the flow of the doc (since it links through to the code at the start) - maybe it should be a separate example?\r\n- There's a bit of redundancy in there (info explained in basics section briefly revisited); is it preferred to cater for people who have come to this page directly by including this, or to keep the doc short and include links to the other pages?",

All TS strict checks are enabled in tests.\r\n\r\n## Reducers\r\n\r\n* Reducers support simple definition where action shape is not type-checked to aid the transition from JS to TS. \r\n* Discriminated union for actions is still supported as well.\r\n* A test is added for writing reducers with type guards.\r\n* Typings for `combineReducers` are updated to allow strict combination using discriminated unions, as well as combining custom and third-party reducers.\r\n\r\nSee [tests](https://github.com/aikoven/redux/blob/typescript-typings/test/typescript/reducers.ts).\r\n\r\n## Dispatch\r\n\r\n* Default `Dispatch` type only accepts plain actions. It also supports restricting action types using discriminated unions.\r\n* Extra signatures are added using intersection type e.g. `Dispatch & PromiseDispatch`.\r\n\r\nSee [tests](https://github.com/aikoven/redux/blob/typescript-typings/test/typescript/dispatch.ts) and [tests for injected dispatch](https://github.com/aikoven/redux/blob/typescript-typings/test/typescript/injectedDispatch.ts) e.g. `connect` from `react-redux`.\r\n\r\n## Middleware\r\n\r\n* Middleware type supports declaring extra Dispatch signatures which are added to the Store type by `applyMiddleware` enhancer.\r\n* Middleware type supports restricting the state type.\r\n\r\nSee [tests](https://github.com/aikoven/redux/blob/typescript-typings/test/typescript/middleware.ts).\r\n\r\n## Store Enhancers\r\n\r\n* Store enhancer type supports extending Store type. Particularly, Dispatch signature is extending using this mechanism. It also supports for adding custom methods.\r\n* Support for enhancers extending the state type.\r\n\r\nSee [tests](https://github.com/aikoven/redux/blob/typescript-typings/test/typescript/enhancers.ts).\r\n\r\ncc. @pelotom @KingHenne",

The removed state branches are then removed from the current state.\r\n\r\nThe state shape is defined here as the union of every path which begins at the state tree root and terminates at a non-plain-object leaf (boolean, number, string, array, etc).\r\n\r\nProperties of a plain object which do not appear in the current or next shape are not pruned.  This covers the use case where a plain object is being used as a dynamic collection of key-value pairs.\r\n\r\nIf any plain object is unchanged by the pruning process, the original object is returned instead of a new one.\r\n\r\nThe state shape for a given reducer is determined by invoking it with an undefined state and the INIT action.\r\n\r\nThe combineReducers warning does not appear in production, so this pruning process also does not take place in production.\r\n\r\nAdded unit test which fails (generates warning) when the pruning process does not take place.\r\n",

To enable the option to dispatch multiple actions (from a middleware for example) without triggering the store listeners for each action.\r\n2. Increase application performance\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nLet's take [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) as an example. Each non-falsy `mapStateToProps` will create a store subscription. When you dispatch a redux action, all store subscription get called. What if I want to dispatch multiple actions in \"one shot\" and only when I finish I want redux store to call my listeners?\r\n\r\nThis is where transactions comes in. you create a transaction with actions dispatches within the transaction body, and when its finish, the store listeners gets called.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nstore.transaction(() => {\r\n    store.dispatch(addTodo('Hello'));\r\n    store.dispatch(filterTodos('new'));\r\n});\r\n\r\n// store listeners will be called after transaction body\r\n```\r\n\r\n### PR Includes\r\n\r\n1. `store.transaction` method to create a transaction.\r\n2. Enhanced `dispatch` method to enable skip listeners when transaction scope is running.\r\n3. Added tests.\r\n4. Fixed tests to work with this PR.",

Then its `dispatch` method can take `A | N`.\r\n- Add a type parameter `A` to `Reducer` which tracks the actions it understands, instead of just using `AnyAction`.\r\n- Use [type parameter defaulting](https://blog.mariusschulz.com/2017/06/02/typescript-2-3-generic-parameter-defaults) everywhere to make this as backwards-compatible as possible.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, type inference for a lot of redux functions improves dramatically, and thus we get more type safety with less effort. I won't pretend these are perfect; in particular I think the middleware/enhancer functions could use some work to make the `N` variables accumulate as appropriate, but it's hopefully a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, upgraded the TypeScript dependency to `^2.4.2`.\r\n\r\n\\* As you can see from some of the modified testcases, in a few rare cases it's necessary to modify type parameter annotations, e.g. when calling `combineReducers`.",

In most of the examples I updated the following without making any associated code changes: enzyme from ^2.4.1 to ^2.8.0, humps from ^1.1.0 to ^2.0.0, normalizr from 3.0.0 to ^3.2.2, react-redux from ^4.4.5 to ^5.0.3, react-router from ^2.6.1 to ^3.0.2, redux-undo from ^0.6.1 to ^1.0.0-beta9, todomvc-app-css from ^2.0.6 to ^2.1.0, and react-scripts from  ^0.9.3 to ^0.9.5. In the universal example there were a number of additional dependencies upgraded which are only in that project.\r\n\r\nI also upgraded redux-logger from ^2.6.1 to ^3.0.0, which required a minor code change wherever createLogger was imported from redux-logger.\r\n\r\nI was unable to upgrade react-router in the real-world example all the way to ^4.0.0. I think I was close to getting it working, but it was taking too long to debug, and seemed like it would need to be a pull request all on it's own.

        "body": "# Preface\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative solution to [Proof of Concept: Enhancer Overhaul #1702](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1702) that attempts to achieve the same goals without constraining enhancers to a more limited API.\r\n\r\nI've compiled [a spreadsheet of store enhancer projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1spgWBp6LkPSz41IhJVDlm-rZk1SttmhySN082_iFTTg/edit?usp=sharing) and examined most of their source code to get a sense of what those enhancers are currently doing.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n1. Reduce the amount of code involved in writing an enhancer.\r\n1. Give enhancers more ability to extend the base store functionality.\r\n1. Limit/avoid breaking changes to the public API to avoid disrupting application developers.\r\n\r\n# Modern Enhancers\r\n\r\nThe major new concept is evolving the current enhancer API (which I will call \"classic enhancers\") to a new API (which I will call \"modern enhancers\"). Here's a simple example of a modern enhancer:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default function logAllActions(store) {\r\n  const actionLog = []\r\n\r\n  function dispatch(action) {\r\n    actionLog.push(action)\r\n    return store.dispatch(action)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // This enhancers adds an actionLog property and overrides the dispatch method\r\n  return { actionLog, dispatch }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA modern enhancer accepts a store and returns a new partial store object with the properties it adds + overrides. Conceptually, a modern enhancer is similar to the Decorator design pattern. Even the core store functionality has been refactored so that it's described as several modern enhancers.\r\n\r\n`createStore` calls the sequence of enhancers to build the final store: \r\n\r\n```js\r\n  const allEnhancers = [\r\n    makeStoreInitializeStateViaDispatch,\r\n    blockReducerFromAccessingStore,\r\n    ...(modernEnhancers || []),\r\n    makeStoreObservable,\r\n    createBaseStore,\r\n  ]\r\n  const finalStore = allEnhancers.reduceRight((store, enhancer) => {\r\n    // details \r\n  }, {})\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the **build phase** of creating the store, in which all the enhancers add their behavior to the store. After the build phase, is the **initialization phase**, when `createStore` calls `finalStore.init({ reducer, preloadedState })`.\r\n\r\n## New: store.init\r\n\r\nSince a modern enhancer doesn't have access to the initial reducer or preloaded state as part of its main method, its opportunity to intercept those values is now done in `store.init`. `init` is also the appropriate time to do things such as subscribing to the store or any external setup calls. For example [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)'s [autoRehydrate](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist/blob/master/src/autoRehydrate.js) enhancer would change from this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default function autoRehydrate (config = {}) {\r\n  const stateReconciler = config.stateReconciler || defaultStateReconciler\r\n    \r\n  return (next) => (reducer, initialState, enhancer) => {\r\n    let store = next(liftReducer(reducer), initialState, enhancer)\r\n    return {\r\n      ...store,\r\n      replaceReducer: (reducer) => {\r\n        return store.replaceReducer(liftReducer(reducer))\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function liftReducer(reducer) { // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default function autoRehydrate (config = {}) {\r\n  const stateReconciler = config.stateReconciler || defaultStateReconciler\r\n\r\n  return store => ({\r\n    init(options) {\r\n      store.init({ ...options, reducer: liftReducer(options.reducer) })\r\n    },\r\n    replaceReducer: (reducer) => {\r\n      return store.replaceReducer(liftReducer(reducer))\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  function liftReducer(reducer) { // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## New: store.final\r\n\r\nBy making `createStore` control the entire build process of the final store, the \"magic\" feature this enables is allowing all the enhancers to have a reference to the final store. This feature was inspired by `applyMiddleware`, and mechanically it works the same way. For example, the base store's `dispatch` method looks like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction createBaseStore(store) {\r\n  let currentReducer = uninitializedReducer\r\n  let currentState = undefined\r\n\r\n  function dispatch(action) {\r\n    validateAction(action)\r\n    currentState = store.final.reducer(currentState, action)\r\n    store.final.onChange()\r\n    return action\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    dispatch,\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe base `dispatch` method invokes the final versions of `reducer` and `onChange`, not just those methods as defined on the base store. This allows other store enhancers to override the default implementations called by `dispatch`. Currently in 3.6, overriding `reducer` requires wrapping it during `createStore` call and also `replaceReducer`. The logic for `onChange` is not overridable in 3.6 and requires an enhancer to wrap `dispatch` and `subscribe`.\r\n\r\n## New: store.reducer\r\n\r\nA common pattern among existing enhancers is wrapping the reducer in a new function, while calling `createStore/next` and also in `replaceReducer`. This pattern can be simplified by putting `reducer` on the store. For example, here is the current version of [install](https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop/blob/master/modules/install.js) from [redux-loop](https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { isNone, execute, batch } = require('./Cmd')\r\n\r\nconst install = () => (next) => (reducer, initialModel, enhancer) => {\r\n  let queue = []\r\n\r\n  const liftReducer = (reducer) => (state, action) => {\r\n    const [model, cmd] = reducer(state, action)\r\n\r\n    if (!isNone(cmd)) {\r\n      queue.push(cmd)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return model\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const store = next(liftReducer(reducer), initialModel, enhancer)\r\n\r\n  const dispatch = (action) => {\r\n    store.dispatch(action)\r\n\r\n    if (queue.length) {\r\n      const currentQueue = queue\r\n      queue = []\r\n      return execute(batch(currentQueue))\r\n        .then((actions) => Promise.all(actions.map(dispatch)))\r\n        .then(() => {})\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return Promise.resolve()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const replaceReducer = (reducer) => {\r\n    return store.replaceReducer(liftReducer(reducer))\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    ...store,\r\n    dispatch,\r\n    replaceReducer,\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = install;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd converted to a modern enhacer, taking advantage of the ability to override `reducer`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { isNone, execute, batch } = require('./Cmd')\r\n\r\nconst install = () => store => {\r\n  let queue = []\r\n\r\n  const reducer = (state, action) => {\r\n    const [model, cmd] = store.reducer(state, action)\r\n\r\n    if (!isNone(cmd)) {\r\n      queue.push(cmd)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return model\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const dispatch = (action) => {\r\n    store.dispatch(action)\r\n\r\n    if (queue.length) {\r\n      const currentQueue = queue\r\n      queue = []\r\n      return execute(batch(currentQueue))\r\n        .then((actions) => Promise.all(actions.map(dispatch)))\r\n        .then(() => {})\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return Promise.resolve()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return { dispatch, reducer }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = install;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## New: store.onChange\r\n\r\nAnother desire of some store enhancers is the ability to control when subscriptions are notified after actions are dispatched. In order to make that simpler, base `dispatch` now invokes `store.final.onChange()`. Additionally the listener subscribe/onChange logic has been extracted into its own file `createEvent`. As an example, this allows [redux-batched-subscribe](https://github.com/tappleby/redux-batched-subscribe/blob/master/src/index.js) to go from this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function batchedSubscribe(batch) {\r\n  if (typeof batch !== 'function') {\r\n    throw new Error('Expected batch to be a function.');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  let currentListeners = [];\r\n  let nextListeners = currentListeners;\r\n\r\n  function ensureCanMutateNextListeners() { // ...\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function subscribe(listener) { // ...\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function notifyListeners() { // ...\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function notifyListenersBatched() {\r\n    batch(notifyListeners);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return next => (...args) => {\r\n    const store = next(...args);\r\n    const subscribeImmediate = store.subscribe;\r\n\r\n    function dispatch(...dispatchArgs) {\r\n      const res = store.dispatch(...dispatchArgs);\r\n      notifyListenersBatched();\r\n      return res;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      ...store,\r\n      dispatch,\r\n      subscribe,\r\n      subscribeImmediate\r\n    };\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createEvent } from 'redux';\r\n\r\nexport function batchedSubscribe(batch) {\r\n  if (typeof batch !== 'function') {\r\n    throw new Error('Expected batch to be a function.');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return store => {\r\n    const batchedOnChange = createEvent();\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      onChange() {\r\n        store.onChange();\r\n        batch(batchedOnChange.invoke);\r\n      },\r\n      subscribe: batchedOnChange.subscribe,\r\n      subscribeImmediate: store.subscribe,\r\n    };\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nSome extra API is needed in order to prevent/minimize disruption of any API changes for application developers. First, because applications are using `compose` to combine enhancers and passing the result of that to `createStore` as the 3rd argument, an adapter is needed to make a modern enhancer backwards compatible. Two methods, `adaptEnhancer` and `adaptEnhancerCreator` are provided to make a modern enhancer match the signature of a classic enhancer.\r\n\r\nWrapping a modern enhancer would look like:\r\n```js\r\nimport { adaptEnhancer } from 'redux'\r\n\r\nexport default adaptEnhancer(function logAllActions(store) {\r\n  const actionLog = []\r\n\r\n  function dispatch(action) {\r\n    actionLog.push(action)\r\n    return store.dispatch(action)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // This enhancers adds an actionLog property and overrides the dispatch method\r\n  return { actionLog, dispatch }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWrapping a modern enhancer that has a factory function would look like:\r\n```js\r\nimport { adaptEnhancerCreator } from 'redux'\r\n\r\nexport default adaptEnhancerCreator(applyMiddleware)\r\n\r\nfunction applyMiddleware(...middleware) {\r\n  return store => {\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Going Further: Simplifying Redux with breaking changes\r\n\r\nSome things not part of this PR, but worth discussing...\r\n\r\n## Good idea: Drop support for `compose` + classic enhancer syntax completely\r\n\r\nThe need for `adaptEnhancer`, `adaptEnhancerCreator`, and `compose` could be removed if `createStore` drops support for the classic enhancer syntax. Some suggestions:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// style A: createStore(reducer, ...enhancers) - Simple and terse, but harder to extend.\r\nconst store = createStore(\r\n  rootReducer,\r\n  preloadState(preloadedState), // make an enhancer called preloadState\r\n  applyMiddleware(thunk, api, createLogger()),\r\n  DevTools.instrument(),\r\n)\r\n\r\n// style B: createStore(options) - All args are passed explicity by name. More verbose but\r\n// more communicative. Easier to add new options in the future if the need arises.\r\nconst store = createStore({\r\n  reducer: rootReducer,\r\n  preloadedState: preloadedState,\r\n  enhancers: [\r\n    applyMiddleware(thunk, api, createLogger()),\r\n    DevTools.instrument(),\r\n  ] \r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benefits of doing so would be a decent reduction in code and the number of concepts that need supported/documented.\r\n\r\n## Moonshot: Middleware are made redundant by store.final and could be phased out\r\n\r\nRedux could be made conceptually simpler if all middleware are then converted to store enhancers.\r\n\r\nFor example here's redux-thunk as middleware:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction createThunkMiddleware(extraArgument) {\r\n  return ({ dispatch, getState }) => next => action => {\r\n    if (typeof action === 'function') {\r\n      return action(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return next(action);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst thunk = createThunkMiddleware();\r\nthunk.withExtraArgument = createThunkMiddleware;\r\n\r\nexport default thunk;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's redux-thunk as an enhancer:\r\n```js\r\nfunction createThunkEnhancer(extraArgument) {\r\n  return store => ({\r\n    dispatch(action) {\r\n      if (typeof action === 'function') {\r\n        return action(store.final.dispatch, store.getState, extraArgument);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return store.dispatch(action);\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst thunk = createThunkEnhancer();\r\nthunk.withExtraArgument = createThunkEnhancer;\r\n\r\nexport default thunk;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe enhancer version has the advantage that `store.final.dispatch` references `dispatch` beyond just the one created by `applyMiddleware`; it is less \"sandboxed.\" An ecosystem-wide refactoring to accomplish this for all middleware would be a very labor intensive operation, so I'm not sure it's worth it. Maybe suggest new projects write code as enhancers instead of middleware?\r\n\r\n# Wrapping up\r\n\r\nMuch like #1702, this is a pretty big change, in mostly the same ways; and most of the main bullet points from that one still apply. The key difference is this solution doesn't limit the enhancers ability to add/override properties to the store, which a good number of enhancers do.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Hey Dan I know you run a tight shift, but I also noticed you recently added an `extraArgument` parameter to `redux-thunk`.  My thinking here is that this makes for a great introduction to \"slicing\" state as described here: http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/BeyondCombineReducers.html \r\n\r\nI think a lot of developers end up using `combineReducers` for a bit too long and end up engaging in various anti-patterns to get access to other states in their reducers, or achieve access in components via other less-than-optimum ways. Slicing state at first can be intimidating and you're almost scared to customize your root reducer. I think a lot of developers--myself included--go through that stage. This is a great bridge for developers toward understanding that their reducer function is really \"just a function,\" while also helping them avoid those anti-patterns. \r\n\r\nIt's really quite limiting at first to think of your reducers as these independent atoms that have no knowledge of  state elsewhere. I know I worked around it way longer than I should. That said, that limitation is one thing that makes Redux really easy to understand at first. It just becomes complicated when you want to do more. This could serve as a taste to inspire them to go further down the path of making custom reducers, while also solving one of the biggest problems developers new to redux will have. For many apps, the missing piece is just one reducer's state that they wish other reducers had access to. Shifting to a very custom reducer from `combineReducers` just to achieve that can be a big \"ask\" for developers new to redux. With this, they just need to treat a single reducer separately in a simple `rootReducer` function, and then pass it to combineReducers and then return both in the final returned state. Basically here's the intended use case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst appReducer = combineReducers(reducers);\r\n\r\nreturn function rootReducer(state={}, action) {\r\n   let location = locationReducer(state.location, action);\r\n   delete state.location; //silence combineReducers warning for passing keys it's unaware of\r\n\r\n   return {\r\n     ...appReducer(state, action, location),\r\n     location,\r\n   };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently in one of my apps, I'm unnecessarily shipping a second `combineReducers` function that does just this. To feed my obsession with keeping bundle size as small as possible, I personally would love to just import the one from redux. Either way, great job with Redux! It really has taken *Reactlandia* to the place it was supposed to go.",

I strongly disagree with this opinion, so I ask for second opinion of @gaearon before you close this PR.\n\nPR solves an issue where I compose reducer produced by `combineReducers` with other reducer (for example by using `reduceReducers`, but also simple applying):\n\n``` js\nconst result = combinedReducer(otherReducer(state, action))\n```\n\n``` js\nconst composedReducer = reduceReducers(combinedReducer, otherReducer)\nconst result = composedReducer(state, action)\n```\n\nIf otherReducer returns keys not used in `combinedReducer`, then `combinedReducer` not only shows a warning that `Unexpected key \"extra\" found in previous state received by the reducer` (what I can leave with evenrually), **but also removes extra keys set by `otherReducer`**.\n\nThis severly limits composability of reducers, and I think it shoudn't be a default behavior of redux.\n\nYou can see simplest example possible in test I attach to this PR, where an extra key is present in state passed to reducer produced with combineReducers, but this keys is missing in result.\n\nThis modification is fully backward compatible, I hope you agree to include it.\n",

Unfortunately it doesn't work properly with Firefox addons, because it requires global _process_ object which is not available inside addon environment. This applies to both web-extensions and jetpack-based addons. In case of web-extensions it is possible make polyfill for _process_ object, but it is not possible with jetpack (at least without [using custom modules loader](https://gist.github.com/empyrical/f1cca44da1f81cb09a26)).\n\nI've fixed this issue by checking if _process_ object exists before using it.

        "body": "This can be useful a couple cases:\n## 1. Reducers with dependencies\n\nIn my opinion the most explicit and convenient way to have one branch of reducers dependent on another branch is to make them have common parent that calculates dependency branch first and then passes its to the dependent reducer:\n\n``` js\nconst dependencyReducer = (state = ..., action) => {...};\n\nconst dependentReducer = (state = ..., action, dependency) => {...};\n\nconst parentReducer = (state = {}, action) => {\n  const {dependency, dependent} = state;\n\n  const nextDependency = dependencyReducer(state, action);\n  const nextDependent = dependentReducer(state, action, nextDependency);\n\n  if (nextDependency !== dependency || nextDependent !== dependent)\n    return {dependency: nextDependency, dependent: nextDependent};\n\n  return state;\n};\n```\n\nThe change in this PR allows `dependentReducer` to be built from smaller parts, each one accepting dependency.\n## 2. Multiple branches of same shape\n\nSuppose we are developing an instant messenger. We can switch between chat views for different contacts and we want to store some data for each view, e.g. entered text, scroll position etc.\n\nLet's structure state like this:\n\n``` js\n{\n  alice: {\n    enteredText: '...',\n    scrollPosition: ...,\n  },\n  bob: {\n    enteredText: '...',\n    scrollPosition: ...,\n  },\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nActions:\n\n``` js\nconst chatOpened = (contact) => ({\n  type: 'CHAT_OPENED',\n  contact,\n});\n\nconst textEntered = (contact, text) => ({\n  type: 'TEXT_ENTERED',\n  contact,\n  text,\n});\n```\n\nMy first approach to this was to have parent reducer look into action's `contact` prop and pass action to `chatViewReducer` for particular branch. But that couples parent to child, parent has to know of all actions that child accepts etc.\n\nSo my current approach is to pass all actions to `chatViewReducer` for all child branches with `contact` passed as third argument:\n\n``` js\nconst chatsReducer = (state = {}, action) => {\n  if (action.type === 'CHAT_OPENED') {\n    return {\n      ...state, \n      [action.contact]: chatViewReducer(undefined, action, action.contact),\n    };\n  }\n\n  const nextState = {};\n  let hasChanged = false;\n\n  for (let contact of Object.keys(state)) {\n    nextState[contact] = chatViewReducer(state[contact], action, contact);\n    hasChanged = hasChanged || nextState[contact]  !== state[contact];\n  }\n\n  return hasChanged ? nextState : state;\n};\n```\n\nOnce again, this change allows `chatViewReducers` to be built from smaller parts each accepting `contact` as third argument, allowing them to filter incoming actions by `contact` to see if they correspond to that particular chat view.\n\nRight now I have a custom `combineReducers` version that is almost the same as original.\n\nAlso, the above pattern can be generalised as reducer factory:\n\n``` js\n/**\n * @param childReducer reducer for state branches\n * @param shouldAddKey function that accepts action and returns undefined or \n *   string key to be added to state\n * @param shouldRemoveKey function that accepts action and returns undefined or\n *   string key to be removed from state\n */\nfunction createMappingReducer(childReducer, shouldAddKey, shouldRemoveKey) {\n  ...\n}\n\nconst chatsReducer = createMappingReducer(chatViewReducer, (action) => {\n  if (action.type === 'CHAT_OPENED')\n    return action.contact;\n});\n```\n",

        "body": "This PR is a better version of #1626.\nPlease see the [original comment](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1626#issue-148879370) for explanation of aims and proposed solution (mainly related to efficiency and effectiveness of code).\n\nIn my opinion the present proposal lowers the computational complexity of the recursive dispatch mechanism and **prevents listeners to be notified more than once with the very same state value during the same call to dispatch**.\nThe cost to be paid is the use of _slice_ and _shift_ operations on listener arrays which is anyway O(N) (with N the number of registered listeners) and usually in the order of microseconds.\n\nThere is another interesting issue which is solved by the present proposal. Consider the following example:\n\n``` javascript\nvar unsubscribe2\nconst store = createStore(myReducer)\n\nstore.subscribe(() => {\n  const state = store.getState()\n\n  if (condition1) {\n    unsubscribe2()\n  }\n\n  if (condition2) {\n    store.dispatch(actionYYY())\n  }\n})\n\nfunction listener2() {\n  // ...\n}\nunsubscribe2 = store.subscribe(listener2)\n\nstore.dispatch(actionXXX())  // --> making true both condition1 and condition2 \n```\n\nWith the current code, in case both _condition1_ and _condition2_ result true at the same time for a particular state, _listener2_ will be notified with the new state value as set because of _actionYYY_ and not as it was set because of _actionXXX_ (when the first listener decided it was the right time to unsubscribe listener2...).\nWith the new code, _listener2_ will be notified its last time right before its actual unsubscription, hence with the state as set by _actionXXX_.\n\nBut that's not all.\nAs a general note I think we should provide a more detailed contract for the _subscribe_ and _unsubscribe_ API calls and listeners notifications.\nWith the present proposal we could be able to state:\n1. listeners will not be notified with state changes in response to calls to _dispatch_ occurred before their subscription (trivial...).\n2. listeners will not be notified with state changes in response to calls to _dispatch_ occurred after unsubscription requests.\n3. listeners will be notified at least once with the most recent state after a call to _dispatch_.\n4. in case of nested calls to _dispatch_, listeners could be notified more than once with updating state values but this is not guaranteed and can easily vary depending on the order of subscriptions.\n5. listeners will be notified at most once with the very same state in response to the very same call to _dispatch_.\n\nBy further modifying dispatch to look like this:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction dispatch(action) {\n\n  let nextState\n  try {\n    isDispatching = true\n    nextState = currentReducer(currentState, action)\n  } finally {\n    isDispatching = false\n  }\n\n  if (nextState !== currentState) {\n    currentState = nextState\n    listeners = currentListeners.slice()\n    while (listeners.length) {\n      listeners.shift()()\n    }\n  }\n\n  return action\n}\n```\n\nat no additional cost, we could change 5. to:\n5. listeners will never be notified twice with the same state value\n\nObvioulsy, secific tests should be added to support these statements.\n...and I'll be happy to add them in case you're interested to proceed further with this.\n",

As we all know: While not enforced, making state objects immutable is a strongly recommended way of using redux (and only then redux plays well together with pure reducers, time traveling and so on).\n\nI found myself felt a bit confused when reading the introduction for the first time. Furthermore I remember to have seen similar comments elsewhere here.\n\nMaybe this little change helps people not getting on the wrong path in the very beginning.\n\nCheers and thanks for checking this,\nMatthias\n",

The `isPlainObject` warning now just checks for `typeof state === 'object'`, so it still warns when something like a `Number` is passed in.\n\nThe keys methods is for iterating over the state keys, which is needed to check for unexpected keys. It can be excluded and will simply warn if the result of the default `Object.keys(...)` doesn't match the reducer shape.\n\nAlso added a param to `getUnexpectedStateShapeWarningMessage` to pass in the already computed `reducerKeys` instead of recalculating them from the reducer.\n",

        "body": "Dan, thanks again for [tweeting about my data-first router called Navigation](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/730747596327813120). Navigation is very different from other routers so I thought you\u2019d enjoy seeing it working beautifully with Redux. I\u2019ve added it to your TodoMVC example because I know routing is something you\u2019re looking at for your upcoming egghead tutorials.\n\nYou can see that, as well as adding browser history, Navigation simplifies your TodoMVC example. There\u2019s no need for React state anymore because the router keeps track of the selected filter. Also, although it\u2019s not shown here, Navigation plays nicely with your Redux optimisations because the Link components auto update after a transition. So, the active Link is never stale even if the parent component doesn\u2019t update.\n\nI want to give you an insight into Navigation\u2019s data-first approach so I\u2019ve intentionally left the route empty in `configureRouter.js`. That means that `filter` starts out as a query string parameter. All the functionality, like defaulting data values and highlighting the active Link, work with `filter` as a query string parameter. You can then change `filter` to a route parameter by setting the route to `{filter?}` and everything still works without changing any other code. Navigation operates on the data, not the URL.\n\nAnother thing that makes Navigation different is that you can test the actual transitions. You can see an example inside `Footer.spec.js` where I transition along the `href` prop of a filter Hyperlink. The transition\u2019s executed by a call to `navigateLink`, after which I assert that the filter\u2019s been set correctly.\n",

This allows for a future in which `createStoreBase` (or whatever we end up naming it) can be exported separately, providing a cleaner integration point for userland experiments and alternative `createStore` APIs that may want to opt-out of those assumptions that, while they may make sense for the majority of Redux consumers, aren't essential to the nature of Redux.\n\nWith this separation, `createStore` is now almost exclusively concerned with subscriptions. I like this because it should make all parties happier: tinkerers can opt-out of \"conveniences\" that they don't like (such as the INIT action) without having to rewrite any subscription logic, which in turn makes the barrier to adding more conveniences to `createStore` lower. This is similar in spirit to how we currently treat combineReducers: if you don't like how it works, you don't have to use it.\n",

I encourage you to avoid bikeshedding on the name for now, and consider the concept instead.\n\nThe \u201cstore base\u201d thing is exactly what we currently pass to the middleware. It\u2019s a stripped down version of the store that offers no subscriptions. It\u2019s just `{ dispatch, getState }`. In this PR, we consider Redux if it was implemented around this abstraction.\n\nSince a \u201cstore base\u201d doesn\u2019t have a subscription mechanism, a function that _creates_ the store base accepts `(reducer, initialState, onChange)` as arguments. **The mechanism of notifying subscribers is implemented at a higher level by the store.**\n\nMaking `onChange` an argument is important for keeping the \u201cstore base\u201d a useful composition abstraction. For example, a \u201cstore base\u201d enhancer may want to wrap `onChange` to debounce calls to all store subscribers without knowing anything about the subscriber logic.\n\nI might be wrong but I have a feeling that **\u201cstore base\u201d enhancers can completely replace store enhancers as the main Redux extension mechanism.** Not also do they offer wrapping `reducer` and `initialState`, but they also have a number of other benefits that store enhancers don\u2019t:\n- They are easier to write because only two methods need to be returned: `getState` and `dispatch`.\n- Unlike store enhancers, \u201cstore base\u201d enhancers don\u2019t need to worry about [wrapping `replaceReducer`](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools/blob/f02ceebc81a8d176e6bc6cc10fa0e3bfac71e57c/src/instrument.js#L407-L409) or [copy-pasting our `$$observable` implementation](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools/blob/f02ceebc81a8d176e6bc6cc10fa0e3bfac71e57c/src/instrument.js#L411-L430) since both of those things are implemented at the store level which \u201cseals\u201d the composed store base enhancers.\n- \u201cStore base\u201d enhancers that implement batching wouldn\u2019t need to [worry about tracking the changes to our change emitter mechanism](https://github.com/tappleby/redux-batched-subscribe/issues/8) because they would be able to wrap (to delay or debounce) `onChange` as they see fit without knowing what\u2019s inside of it.\n- If store \u201cseals off\u201d the enhanced \u201cstore base\u201d chain as shown in this PR, enhancers won\u2019t be able to put arbitrary methods on the store. (Arguably some enhancers do that today, but the overall system is less fragile if we just disallow this.)\n- The `INIT` action goes through all enhancers and middleware because it is emitted outside the \u201cstore base\u201d chain in the store itself. The store has the ability to enforce that the initial action is dispatched synchronously, as it can check the current state right after the first dispatch. (#465)\n- This would also leave us with just one API for applying enhancers (the modern one) because the old way would give you a store without a `subscribe` method.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t even quite introduce a _new_ concept, as we already pass a thing with the same API to middleware. We\u2019re just giving it a name (rather than a vague \u201cmiddleware API\u201d) and using more prominently. Also, it is only relevant to people who write store enhancers.\n\nThe only downside I can think of so far is the documentation / tutorial update / ecosystem costs, but luckily we never documented enhancers thoroughly, and we only have a few popular ones. In fact many some enhancers should just work unless they forget to pass all arguments, add custom methods, or specifically handle `subscribe` (in which case they\u2019d be better off handling `onChange` instead anyway). And we don\u2019t need to be stuck in an update limbo because we can release a 4.0 alpha that switches `enhancer` argument to mean a \u201cstore base\u201d enhancer, and send some PRs to popular enhancers, and then roll it out when everybody is happy.\n\nThoughts? I know this is a big change, but we barely had any breaking changes since the release, and if there are no other problems, I feel this moves Redux closer to what I originally [tried to pull off with separating dispatching from subscribing when I was first thinking about Redux](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/c02f3eb38724b64ab812). I\u2019d be much more comfortable with this store extension mechanism than what we have now, but if I\u2019m wrong please help me understand why.\n\n@acdlite @zalmoxisus @tappleby @tomkis1 @yelouafi @timdorr @lukewestby\n",

This pauses the loop currently used to notify all listeners and starts a new one at a deeper nested level.\n\nWhen resuming back to higher levels, all the listeners have already been notified and the paused loop doesn't actually need to be completed.\n\nAs an example, consider the following code:\n\n``` javascript\nvar Redux = require('redux');\n\nvar numIncrementers = 3;\nvar numListeners = 5;\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n  if (typeof state === 'undefined') {\n    return 0\n  }\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nvar store = Redux.createStore(reducer)\n\n\nfunction createListener(store, name, value) {\n  var lastState = null;\n  return function () {\n    var state = store.getState();\n    if (state === lastState) {\n      console.log(name, 'state changed FALSE');\n      return;\n    }\n    lastState = state;\n\n    if (!!value && state === value) {\n      console.log(name, 'state changed TRUE INCREMENT!');\n      store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });\n    } else {\n      console.log(name, 'state changed TRUE');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nvar i = 1;\nfor( ; i <= numIncrementers; i++)\n  store.subscribe(createListener(store, 'listener_' + i, i));\nfor( ; i <= numListeners; i++)\n  store.subscribe(createListener(store, 'listener_' + i))\n\n\n// Trigger first action\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });\n```\n\nHere a number of listeners subscribe to the store and the first three of them trigger an increment action only in case the current value for the state is equal to their `id`.\n\nThe following is the log I get with the current code:\n\n```\n0 listener_1 state changed TRUE INCREMENT!\n1 listener_1 state changed TRUE\n1 listener_2 state changed TRUE INCREMENT!\n2 listener_1 state changed TRUE\n2 listener_2 state changed TRUE\n2 listener_3 state changed TRUE INCREMENT!\n3 listener_1 state changed TRUE\n3 listener_2 state changed TRUE\n3 listener_3 state changed TRUE\n3 listener_4 state changed TRUE\n3 listener_5 state changed TRUE\n2 listener_4 state changed FALSE\n2 listener_5 state changed FALSE\n1 listener_3 state changed FALSE\n1 listener_4 state changed FALSE\n1 listener_5 state changed FALSE\n0 listener_2 state changed FALSE\n0 listener_3 state changed FALSE\n0 listener_4 state changed FALSE\n0 listener_5 state changed FALSE\n```\n\n(I've added by hand the recursion level on the leftmost column)\n\nWith the proposed modification, the output would be only the following one:\n\n```\n0 listener_1 state changed TRUE INCREMENT!\n1 listener_1 state changed TRUE\n1 listener_2 state changed TRUE INCREMENT!\n2 listener_1 state changed TRUE\n2 listener_2 state changed TRUE\n2 listener_3 state changed TRUE INCREMENT!\n3 listener_1 state changed TRUE\n3 listener_2 state changed TRUE\n3 listener_3 state changed TRUE\n3 listener_4 state changed TRUE\n3 listener_5 state changed TRUE\n```\n\nThe idea is to prune the exploration of the recursive dispatch calls and stop notifying once the deepest notification loop completes. After this point in time each listener was already notified and it does not need to check the status on the same chain of actions.\n\nPlease let me know what do you think about this schema and do not hesitate to start a discussion on it.\n",

I'm not 100% sure how to check the previous state vs the current one, so please help out on this if I misunderstood this completely in the PR or haven't got the code to do what I wanted it to.\n### Why this PR?\n\nWe want the user to know that he is setting the previous state. Maybe he/she doesn't even need to do that. This helps users to maybe refactor the code they want in a more effective matter.\n### Functionality\n\nIt warns possible \"empty\" states/previousStates that are the same.\n### What has been changed?\n\nThe only thing added is a new warning function along with a conditional to check if this is true. Note that I'm not sure if I set it up correctly. It ran through tests fine, but would be convenient to double-check this.\n## Note\n\nA lot of small patches, as I had a mixed thought about checking if the string is empty or if we just could do a normal conditional between two variables. Naturally last option was more reasonable.\n",

        "body": "Hi! Been trying to add Symbol as a feature of Redux. As you know, symbols are immutable and this would be a great 2nd choice for people that will have static actions to use. While implementing this, I ran into two issues.\n\n1.\" Move function declaration to program root \" - This has to be adjusted to have symbols as a second action creator.\n2. Invalid code -  I'm not sure if the code is 100%. What we could do, is to make functions out of the mapping of the symbols for `Object.key(mykey)` , for it to fully function.\n\nI decided make two different instances of the actioncreator. The first try of embedding a for loop inside this snippet:\n\n `for(var i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n    var key = keys[i]\n    var actionCreator =`actionCreators[key]\n\n```\nif(typeof actionCreator === 'function') {\n  boundActionCreators[key] = bindActionCreator(actionCreator, dispatch)\n}\n```\n\n  }\n  return boundActionCreators\n}`\n\n...  was ok ( a for loop within the for loop), but it sent two requests to the dispatcher/actioncreator head function, which resulted in an error in the debugger. The solution was to make two separate actioncreator functions, but also, this would be embedded as an conditional if the first actioncreator could not find an object or an function, like a fallback. This also failed since the debugger wanted it to be passed to the \"program root\". \n\n**So, why this PR?**\n1. Support Symbols\n   1. Addressing fallback actioncreators\n\nAlso, if someone would like to fix this, please, do help, it would be awesome!  :tiger: \n\nLet me add that you should watch the PR code, since I'm terrible to explain stuff.\n",

It takes an action and returns it. It aligned with default behavior of `redux`. Any extension middleware could extend it by adding other signatures. For instance, `redux-thunk` can add a call signature that takes a function, and `redux-promise` can add one that takes a promise. So that any end interface shape will be determined by set of modules imported. This \"module augmentation\" approach is shown in `dispatch.ts` test.\n- `Middleware` now is a function that returns a function that gets a dispatch and returns new dispatch.\n\nDefinitions have been tested with TypeScript 1.8.7.\n",

It results in lots of business logic being forced into Action Creators. This means Action Creators are now becoming decision-makers in _how_ state gets updated, rather than fulfilling their purpose of simply formatting an action object. When Action Creators own the business logic of what gets sent, actions end up being more like imperative commands tailored to a specific reducer as opposed to a description of an event that any reducer can react to as it sees fit. This goes against one of Redux's main strengths of decoupling actions from the reducer functions that handle them.\n\nTesting becomes more difficult as now you're having to test your Action Creators for logic that's dependent on state and now buried in the returned action object. Testing reducers is a breeze since they are pure functions and you're testing input state vs. output state.\n\nIt also prevents you from reusing Reselect selectors inside of your reducers.\n\nI still think having the sliced state as the first argument passed to a reducer is the right design choice for convenience, as that prevents you from having to slice it yourself and ensure you're returning the correct slice again from the function. However, that convenience should not be the reason for logic being forced into other parts of the application. Having access to the full store state as an additional argument will let reducers keep the separation of concerns clear.\n",

        "body": "This PR follows https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1413. I will open up some wounds here, so please excuse me if I missed any of the points in the previous conversation.\n\n**Signature of dispatch**\n\nThe problem that I still have is with the signature of `dispatch`. `any` just isn't type-safe at all. It will propagate silently in the app without the developer even realizing. w.r.t what @pajn and @joshuacc said, there is a difference between consciously making a choice to type-cast and getting `any` by default. With this in mind, it's even better to use `{}` instead of `any` (which btw is what type parameters default to anyway). \n\nGiven the nature of `dispatch` and it being wrapped by middlewares, it isn't possible to properly type it to account for every possibility. (goes with what @xogeny said in previous PR) The default behavior should be to receive `Action` and return `Action`. When middlewares are involved, the middleware decides what the action is and what is returned. Unless someone finds of a way to augment the dispatch signature to work auto-magically with specific middlewares, I think it's better to let the user cast explicitly, because it is something known only by him, given the combination of middlewares that he applied.\n\nI understand that explicit cast is more verbose and some may even be tempted to say it's even annoying, but think of it this way: it isn't any different than using `Promise` or `Map` or `Set`. Only the user know what exactly he's dispatching and what he expects to be returned.\n\n**Signature of StoreCreator and StoreEnhancer**\n\nI'm not sure I fully understand how these work, but the signature looks different to me than what results from the source code: https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/src/createStore.js#L49\n\nShould be something like:\n\n``` typescript\n    interface StoreEnhancer<TState> {\n         (createStore: StoreCreator<TState>): (reducer: Reducer<TState>, initialState?: TState) => Store<TState>;\n    }\n```\n\nIn this case `StoreEnhancer` should be generic. This leads to another problem. If it's typed as a generic interface, then `StoreCreator` should be generic as well, in which case we can no longer type the `createStore` variable. The only way I see to fix this would be to create to interfaces that are basically copy-pastes of each other:\n\n``` typescript\nexport interface StoreCreatorInferrable {\n  <S>(reducer: Reducer<S>, enhancer?: StoreEnhancer): Store<S>;\n  <S>(reducer: Reducer<S>, initialState: S,\n      enhancer?: StoreEnhancer): Store<S>;\n}\nexport interface StoreCreator<S> {\n  (reducer: Reducer<S>, enhancer?: StoreEnhancer<S>): Store<S>;\n  (reducer: Reducer<S>, initialState: S,\n      enhancer?: StoreEnhancer<S>): Store<S>;\n}\n```\n",

Both plugin transform and proxy wrapping are rather invasive and have edge cases\n2. It\u2019s **experimental tech** and beginners shouldn\u2019t have to deal with its warts\n3. It doesn\u2019t currently reload functional components or container functions like `mapStateToProps`\n4. In Redux we rarely care about preserving component local state when hot reloading! Preserving store state is usually enough.\n\nThis is a proof of concept of \u201cvanilla\u201d hot reloading (for now, only for a single example).\n\nIt has the following traits.\n## Pros\n1. It is absolutely non-invasive and doesn\u2019t change semantics of your code\n2. It hot reloads any components, whether classes or functions\n3. It preserves the store state on hot reload\n4. It still handles errors on mount and hot reloading \u201cfixes\u201d them\n5. It works for functions like `mapStateToProps`\n## Cons\n1. It does _not_ preserve the local state of components\n2. It does _not_ preserve the DOM so the components are remounted\n\nWhat do you think? Should we proceed with this and do this for every example?\n",

That build is identical to the CommonJS build _except_ that it doesn\u2019t include the `transform-es2015-modules-commonjs` Babel plugin.\n\nHowever we have a problem here. We started using Lodash 4.x recently. Lodash modules are CommonJS builds and offer no ES6 equivalents. Therefore, even with this PR, if you try to [use Redux in a Rollup project with `npm({ jsnext: true })`](https://github.com/gaearon/rollup-starter-project/pull/1), you will see the following error:\n\n```\n> rollup-starter-project@1.0.0 build /Users/gaearon/p/rollup-starter-project\n> rollup -c rollup.config.umd.js && rollup -c rollup.config.es6.js\n\nModule redux/node_modules/lodash/isPlainObject.js does not export default (imported by redux/es-modules/combineReducers.js)\n```\n\nThis would be a non-issue if Lodash offered an ES modules build of its modules. For example, `lodash/es-modules/isPlainObject` that would be identical to `lodash/isPlainObject` but used ES Modules `import` and `export` instead of CommonJS.\n\nAnother possible fix is to give up on offering ES modules with Babel build, and instead build a separate ES6 single file bundle using either Webpack or Rollup itself.\n\nI welcome comments and discussion around this because I really want to fix things for Rollup users on our end.\n\ncc @Rich-Harris @dchambers @taion @flying-sheep\n",

This key ties your state and could be modified and not returned correctly on a refresh. This it definitely an edge case but I was curious if it was possible to return the user to the exact \"state\" that they were at the time of the action. So I used `history.go` while keeping a history index of where the browser was at the time of the location.\n\nOne thing that does **not work** in my attempt is going forward, this is due to an extra action being dispatched on the `go` (despite the `isTimeTraveling = true`). You'll notice that the key is identical to the state that it tried to reset to.\n",

In addition, it seems to me that middleware is suboptiomal API for the DevTools replay functionality.\n\nThis pull request is an attempt at starting a discussion around what `react-router-redux` could look like if instead of using middleware, we wrapped the `history` object itself. To me, this seems a more natural approach to this problem, and seems to fix some issues with the current DevTools support such as rackt/react-router-redux#252.\n\nIn this PR we:\n- Remove dependency on `react-router-redux` and use `react-router` as is\n- Demonstrate how we can preserve record/replay/time travel features while using vanilla `history` API\n- Implement a function that is similar in spirit to the original `redux-simple-router` in terms of its simple API\n\nIf there is interest on `react-router-redux` side and there are no apparent problems with this approach, we may want to use that as its evolution. Otherwise we may publish something like this independently. I have not considered server rendering here, so please let me know if I am way off, and this approach is broken in some way.\n\nFinally, let me acknowledge that I took 80% of the logic from `react-router-redux`. My only contribution here is slightly tweaking the API to emphasize vanilla `react-router` usage and fixing some edge cases in DevTools support.\n\nI will link to this PR on `react-router-redux` as well.

I do see some speedups on Chrome and Firefox when rendering many components (which happen to call `bindActionCreators`) but I'm not sure whether this optimization is worth it, and whether it has downsides on other browsers/engines. **I\u2019m not very knowledgeable in JS performance so I hope somebody else can share their perspective on this.**\n\nIn my testing this improves performance when you create many connected components of the same type. For example, when a list view adds many rows. It is wasteful to bind the same action creator to the same `dispatch` function over and over again.\n\nHere, we use `WeakMap` if available to cache the bound action creators. Using `WeakMap` allows us to prevent leaks on the server where you'd have a separate store instance on every request.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n",

This would keep the concept of enhancers and their API exactly the same but will simplify applying them in real projects. This is also not a breaking change because we didn\u2019t support any additional arguments to `createStore()` previously.\n\n``` js\n// not bad\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  initialState,\n  applyMiddleware(thunk, logger)\n)\n\n// not too bad either\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  initialState,\n  compose(\n    applyMiddleware(thunk, logger),\n    DevTools.instrument()\n  )\n)\n```\n\nIt has often been suggested that we do something about this uneasiness but unfortunately I don\u2019t think there was ever any specific proposal that dealt with store enhancers correctly. Most proposals I saw were focused on the middleware which is just one kind of a store enhancer. I think that this proposal should satisfy the needs of the community in terms of a simple API without compromising on the power of store enhancers.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",

IMO this more focused example makes is easier to understand without sorting through the visual noise of the adjacent array spread syntax. The key takeaway should be how object spread contrasts with `Object.assign()` -- I don't think people will lose sight of the big picture because of not reproducing the whole previous example, but it will be easier to see the key difference. If it's not clear to them how the syntax can be applied to any object literal, they're probably better off not using it yet.\n",

        "body": "Thank you for Redux. It\u2019s a beautiful way to handle web state. The one missing piece is how Hyperlinks fit into the picture. This is why you had trouble deciding where to hold the filter parameter in the todomvc example. In this project you added it to the React component state but in your egghead tutorial you added it to the Redux store. In this PR, I show that neither location is correct. The filter is part of the URL and so should live with the router.\n\nThis PR adds routing to the todomvc example to show how Redux and Hyperlinks should fit together. I\u2019ve used my [Navigation router](http://grahammendick.github.io/navigation/). Like Redux, the Navigation router can be used with any JavaScript application, with a separate npm package providing the React-specific Hyperlink components. You can see that the Navigation router has simplified the code quite a bit. Most importantly, the filter isn\u2019t stored in React state anymore. Instead, it\u2019s held in the Navigation router and passed in as props whenever the URL changes.\n\nThe filter isn\u2019t part of the Redux store, it\u2019s part of the Navigation router. To capture the state of a web page, you need the URL together with the store: URL + store = web state. The Navigation router owns the URL and Redux owns the store. So, there are two different types of time travelling. You can either time travel the URL or time travel the store. You use the Redux developer tools to time travel the store and the browser back button to time travel the URL.\n",

        "body": "Hey folks,\n\nFirst ever open source contribution here and a Redux newb, so I have no idea what I'm doing! Alright, with that out of the way...\n\nI was reading the test cases for `combineReducers` and noticed that [this test](https://github.com/rackt/redux/blob/64a489bf2d97d0e7c125d6142da4da57aed400ce/test/combineReducers.spec.js#L154-L173) doesn't really test what it intends to test because if you change the `default` case to return a value, the reducer will not throw and the test will fail.\n\nI changed the way Redux inits reducers by making it do an init and a random probe at the same time. This will make it impossible for users to handle private Redux actions, so there's no need for that test anymore. However, I altered the test to make it assert that Redux checks reducers to make sure they return the current state for an unknown action.\n",

My PR fixes this problem by simply passing \"rest\" of the arguments to other reducers (using spread operator).\n\nI hope this is a valuable change to the code-base (well, it definitely helped me a lot to decouple my code into smaller chunks), if there is anything else to do about it (like changing the docs or writing some tests), please just let me know.\n",

        "body": "The tutorial for the TodoMVC app in documentation, the visibleTodos prop is passed to TodoList, which is mapped into a new array -- which I will call visibleTodos -- and rendered into Todo components. Upon doing so, the visibleTodos array now is at risk of becoming unlinked with the state.todos array as soon as a single item is completed. \n\nBecause the completeTodo reducer relies on parity between the indexes of the visibleTodos array and the state.todos array, bugs can occur when in trying to dispatch a completeTodo action in SHOW_ACTIVE view mode. The bug occurs because the visibleTodos array can be shorter than the state.todos array, and any index in the list can be filtered out once completed. \n\nIn the screen shot below, \"third\" has already been completed. When clicking on \"fourth\" todo  -- the fourth item in the state.todos array and third item in the visibleTodos array, the payload informs the app that it should complete the third item in the array, so nothing happens. \n![screen shot 2015-09-24 at 10 20 41 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7918530/10075840/095aecec-62a6-11e5-86b5-dae69eb5a56b.png)\n\nLikewise, when clicking on the \"fifth\" todo --- fifth in state.todos but fourth in visibleTodos, it completes the \"fourth\" item by dispatching a payload targeting the index: 3.\n![screen shot 2015-09-24 at 10 21 03 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7918530/10075901/5e758ba6-62a6-11e5-993f-8bd71a0447ff.png)\n\nI have crafted two solutions. The first is to map a uuid to each todo and have the completeTodo action splice the array using the index returned by Array.prototype.findIndex(todo.id) instead of the current position of the Todo in the visibleTodos array. This solution fixes the inaccuracies of the reducer, but it also requires actions and the reducer to be rewritten and another module to be installed.  I'm not a fan.\n\nInstead, why not pass the filtering mechanisms themselves to TodoList component via props by altering the selectTodos helper to return functions instead of filtered arrays? Now we are free to pass the entire state.todos array to TodoList and simply not render any todo within it that doesn't return true when passed to the filtering function. This keeps our state consistent across components without altering any reducers or actions. I believe this to be the elegant solution. It is included in this PR. \n\nMy apologies for such a big switch.\n",

The `replaceState` would look similar to this PR, but would pass in the state value and then run the init dispatch:\n\n``` js\n/**\n * Replaces the state tree with a new value and runs \"INIT\"\n *\n * @returns {void}\n */\nfunction replaceState(newState) {\n  currentState = newState;\n  dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.INIT });\n}\n\n\n// When a store is created, an \"INIT\" action is dispatched so that every\n// reducer returns their initial state.

        "body": "Hi,\n\nAs our Redux project grows at our company, we have found useful to get the last dispatched action at the beginning of a `store.subscribe` like this:\n\n``` javascript\nstore.subscribe(() => {\n    const { records } = store.getState(); // a reducer that holds every action ever dispatched\n    const lastAction = records[records.length - 1];\n```\n\nBut that approach is not reliable every time: if we wait too long before accessing `records[records.length - 1]` we might end up with another action dispatched in the meanwhile.\n\nSo we thought, in `createStore.js`, what about calling `listener` with the dispatched action as argument ?\n\n``` javascript\nlisteners.slice().forEach(listener => listener(action));\n```\n\nThat would allow developers to use `store.subscribe()` as a way to create action-based side-effects, thus making Redux even more flexible.\n\nWould anyone else like this ?\n\nThanks for the lib.\n",

        "body": "_Note: this PR should not be merged, it's just here for discussion and will require improvements_\n\nI've been porting some of the Firefox devtools code to use a redux-like architecture (not actually Redux yet because we need to clean stuff up first), and it's been interesting to try to implement complex use cases. Porting my blog to redux has also helped gain insight on where we can do better.\n\nI used to think that it was really nice and clean for **all** async work to only happen in action creators, using something like the thunk middleware. It is neat to consolidate complex workflows there, and reducers stay pure and synchronous. But there are a few downsides:\n- You frequently want to do things that heavily depend on the shape of the state, like caching. See here in my blog: https://github.com/jlongster/blog/blob/e9224e6113399ca6f26f4a0eb1360b4df37e26fa/src/actions/blog.js#L26. The logic for caching it split apart in two places: one where it sets the cache and the other where it checks it. That's not too bad though.\n- You also want to do more complex things like control the asynchronous flow: batching requests, forcing specific order of network calls, etc. You actually can't do this at all with async action creators, because this inherently requires the ability to read the flow of actions being dispatched and perform side effects.\n\nI've seen [redux-remotes](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-remotes) which aims to solve this as well. It allows you do read from the stream of actions and perform async calls based on them, and you have access to `dispatch` and `getState` like in an action creator. But I don't like that it introduces _another_ primitive, when we already have action creators and reducers.\n\nThere's also #307 and other issues, and I'm sure there will be lots of opinions about this.\n\n@gaearon has been tweeting about Elm recently, and he's right: Elm has been leading the pack here, and it'd be good to follow it's steps. In Elm, you do something that up until now we've been preaching against: reducers can have \"side effects\", which essentially are just async work. At this point I'm ready to just give up and embrace side effects in reducers.\n\nThis PR adds the ability for reducers to return side effects, which are just functions that have access to `dispatch` and `getState` (like async action creators).\n\n**Example:**\n\n``` js\nconst initialState = {\n  itemsById: {}\n};\n\nfunction items(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch(action.type) {\n  case constants.FETCH_ITEM:\n    return withSideEffect(state, dispatch => {\n      dispatch({\n        type: constants.FETCHING_ITEM,\n        status: 'begin'\n      });\n\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        dispatch({\n          type: constants.FETCHING_ITEM,\n          status: 'success',\n        });\n      }, 1000);\n    })\n  case constants.FETCHING_ITEM:\n    if(action.status === 'success') {\n      const item = action.value;\n      return {\n        itemsById: Object.assign({}, state.itemsById, { [item.id]: item })\n      };\n    }\n  default:\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis works by using `withSideEffect` to return a state object and a side effect. You are free to run this side effect or not. In the normal scenario, side effects are run after the reducers are run in `dispatch`. But if you were replaying actions, you would simply ignore the side effects.\n\nWe don't have a type system like Elm, but we can **take advantage** of our dynamic typing by returning a class instance so that we can internally check it. I added an internal `StateAndEffect` class, and check if that is returned, and if true I know side effects are returned. It doesn't matter that this is a class instance because we _never_ care about serializing side effects.\n\nIt's basically a monadic operation but I decided against the terms \"lift\" and \"unlift\".\n## Higher Order Reducers\n\nWe could apply the higher-order concept here too, if you want to separate pure reducers and reducers with side effects:\n\n``` js\n\n// items.js\nconst initialState = {\n  itemsById: {}\n};\n\nfunction items(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch(action.type) {\n  case constants.FETCHING_ITEM:\n    if(action.status === 'success') {\n      const item = action.value;\n      return {\n        itemsById: Object.assign({}, state.itemsById, { [item.id]: item })\n      };\n    }\n  default:\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n\n// itemFetcher.js\nconst items = require('./items');\n\nfunction itemFetcher(reducer) {\n  return (state, action) => {\n    switch(action.type) {\n    case constants.FETCH_ITEM:\n      // We still call the lower reducer, but we don't really have to\n      // in this scenario\n      return withSideEffect(reducer(state, action), dispatch => {\n        dispatch({\n          type: constants.FETCHING_ITEM,\n          status: 'begin'\n        });\n\n        setTimeout(() => {\n          dispatch({\n            type: constants.FETCHING_ITEM,\n            status: 'success',\n          });\n        }, 1000);\n      });\n    default:\n      // On the init action, this *should* pass undefined as state so\n      // it still gets the correct initialState, right?\n      return reducer(state, action);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// One problem here though is that this will be attached to the state as `state.itemFetcher`,\n// not `state.items` but I'm sure that's solvable\nmodule.exports = itemFetcher(items);\n```\n\n`withSideEffect` is monadic: if passed another `StateAndEffect` type is will correctly compose the state and effect into a new `StateAndEffect` type. When the side effects run, both the effects from this reducer and any lower reducer will run.\n## Advanced Example: Ordering Requests\n\nHere's an example of something you can't do with async action creators. Say you want to do an HTTP request because an action comes through. That's fine. But if the user wants to initiate multiple of these requests, you want to make _sure_ that only one happens at a time. Additionally, for simplicity, if multiple come through before the first finishes, we just do an additional **single** request after the first one finishes (we don't run 5 in order if 5 comes through at once, we run 1 to completion and then run an addition 1 request).\n\nDemo here: http://jlongster.github.io/redux-experiments/side-effects/\nCode here: https://github.com/jlongster/redux-experiments/tree/master/side-effects\n\nThe neat part is that we can use the sequence of actions to control what actual side effects happen, and I can extract this functionality out into a single library. Let's call it `ensureCompleted`:\n\n``` js\nconst { withSideEffect } = require('redux');\n\nfunction ensureCompleted(initialState, fetchActionType, statusActionType, reducer) {\n  // This could be more complex, of course, just keeping it simple for\n  // a demo\n  let queued = false;\n  let fetching = false;\n\n  return (state = initialState, action) => {\n    switch(action.type) {\n    case fetchActionType:\n      if(fetching) {\n        queued = true;\n        return state;\n      }\n      fetching = true;\n      return reducer(state, action);\n\n    case statusActionType:\n      if(action.status === 'success') {\n        if(queued) {\n          queued = false;\n          fetching = false;\n          return withSideEffect(reducer(state, action), dispatch => {\n            dispatch({ type: fetchActionType });\n          });\n        }\n        else {\n          fetching = false;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    return reducer(state, action);\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = ensureCompleted;\n```\n\nThis is a higher-order reducer, and wraps the item fetcher reducer here: https://github.com/jlongster/redux-experiments/blob/master/side-effects/reducers/items.js#L50. The item fetcher reducer simply does the async call blindly, unknowing that it's actually being batched/reordered/whatever.\n## Questions\n- Does this mess up any higher-order stores or middleware? Only anything dealing with what comes back from a reducer needs to know about this, and I don't think this will break any libs.\n- I'm still not sure about composition of effects. Higher-order reducers are neat, but they mess up how we currently combine reducers. The name of the higher-order reducer will be used as the name of the piece of state, when you probably want it to be something else (the \"dumb\" reducer). Elm takes quite a different approach to composing state it seems. \"Reducers\" are just simple models that can be composed: https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/#example-6-pair-of-random-gif-viewers.\n\nFor example, let's say I have a reducer that fetches blog posts and stores them. I fetch a blog post with an id of `foo`. But the blog post also has a \"readnext\" property which is the id of the next blog post to read, and I need to fetch that after I get `foo`. In normal async world I'd do something like this:\n\n``` js\nlet post = yield getPost('foo');\nlet readnext = null;\nif(post.readnext) {\n  readnext = yield getPost(post.readnext);\n}\n```\n\nI'd love to figure out how to fit all of this into something that doesn't obfuscate the async workflow too much.\n- Currently I run side effects on the next turn of the event loop (after calling the reducer) because it could immediately dispatch, and you don't want cascading dispatches. This feels a little weird, but I don't know if that's an indication that this is the wrong path or there's a better fix for that.\n\nThis is a bit of a braindump, I hope it isn't too confusing. I didn't spend much time gently introducing these concepts, so if you are confused, check out this Elm tutorial first: https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/. Let me know what you think. Or if I'm horribly, horribly wrong.\n",

Checking local cache\n\nMart's fetch API uses the \"`id`\" to avoid duplicate requests (similar to the \"`meta.httpRequest.url`\" here), but it also has all that `locally()` `remotely()` stuff to try and manage the local cache, and unfortunately [does not give a lot of control over invalidating the cache](https://github.com/martyjs/marty/issues/354).\n#### Why add it to the Ecosystem section?\n\nI want this library to be very simple, and do one thing and one thing well (local cache management should be left up to the developer).

Just wanted to show the progress so far and if anyone wants to chime in and give feedback, more than welcome!\n\nI have a temporary file in the counter example that is the actual one being type checked, instead of the real entry point (since I haven't yet typed the other util functions), which is `sample.js`. If you want to play around, uncommenting the lines there and running `flow` will correctly show the type errors.\n\nYou may need to change the counter's `package.json` dependencies to make `redux` point to `file:../../` so that it grabs the code from the real source instead of npm (which doesn't have flow types yet).\n\nCaveat so far: There is a bug in Flow (https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/582) which forces us to explicitly specify the init action type inside the union list of the app's action types. Until that gets fixed, I'm afraid we'll need to keep doing that instead of having that type provided by `redux` itself, which is defined in the `flow/types.js` file but not used.\n",

        "body": "This PR updates the middleware API in several ways.\n## All middleware is now smart middleware\n\nThe API becomes much simpler if we just assume that all middleware is \"smart\" middleware. I know previously I argued against something like this:\n\n``` js\n(dispatch, getState, next) => action => {...}\n```\n\nbecause it's fragile, hard to compose, and awkward to use from the call site. I also figured most middleware wouldn't need either `dispatch()` or `getState()`. But as we discovered with the thunk middleware, any asynchronous middleware is going to need `dispatch()` so that it can dispatch from the beginning of the chain. So let's just make all middleware \"smart\" like this:\n\n``` js\nmethods => next => action {...}\n```\n\nwhere `methods` is a subset of the store, currently `{ dispatch, getState }`. Now it's easy to compose using just function composition. And if users have already written their own \"dumb\" middleware, all they need to do to update is wrap it in one more function:\n\n``` js\nconst smartMiddleware = () => dumbMiddleware;\n```\n## `applyMiddleware(...middlewares)`\n\nNow that all middleware is smart middleware, we don't have to deal with [this nonsense](https://github.com/gaearon/redux/pull/195#issuecomment-117937929). We get a nice, simple API for applying middleware:\n\n``` js\nconst finalCreateStore = applyMiddleware(thunk, promise, observable)(createStore);\n```\n\n`applyMiddleware()` is a higher-order store, just like @gaearon's devtools (I assume... haven't seen the final version yet.). So, it composes!\n\n``` js\nconst finalCreateStore = compose(\n  applyMiddleware(thunk, promise, observable)\n  devtools,\n  createStore\n);\n```\n## Caveat: `thunkMiddleware()` is no longer built-in to `createStore()`\n\nThis is because middleware needs to come before any other higher-order stores, since middleware has the potential to be asynchronous.\n\nHowever! It is still the default when using `applyMiddleware()`. It's additional step versus today, but I imagine most users will be using `applyMiddleware`, anyway:\n\n``` js\nconst finalCreateStore = applyMiddleware()(createStore);\n\n// Same as\nconst finalCreateStore = applyMiddleware(thunk)(createStore);\n```\n### Updated `composeMiddleware()`\n\nI updated `composeMiddleware()` to support the new signature. In the process, I also discovered a bug with the previous implementation where it only works if dispatch is the last argument. It did not combine multiple middlewares into a single middlewares as advertised; it only combined multiple middlewares with dispatch to create a new dispatch.\n\nThe reason is because it was simply doing function composition, where `compose(a, b, c)` becomes `a(b(c))`. But this isn't right, because this\n\n``` js\nm1(m2(m3(dispatch))\n```\n\nis not the same this\n\n``` js\nm1(m2(m3))(dispatch)\n```\n\nWhich means previously we couldn't do this, as advertised in the docs (and by, ya know, the name of the function):\n\n``` js\nconst middleware = composeMiddleware(m1, m2, m3);\nconst finalDispatch = middleware(dispatch);\n```\n\nI fixed the issue and updated the test. We'll need to update the docs in master, too, as they're currently incorrect.\n\nI've renamed the previous method to just `compose()`, since it's still useful elsewhere.\n",

It now accepts an object instead of a single `getState` function. The `dispatch` function lets you \u201crecurse\u201d the middleware chain and is useful for async: #113 (comment).\n### Correctness changes\n- The `dispatch` provided by the default thunk middleware now walks the whole middleware chain.\n- It is enforced now that raw Actions at the end of the middleware chain have to be plain objects.\n- Nested dispatches are now handled gracefully. (#110, #119)\n### Internal changes\n- The object in React context is renamed from <s>`redux`</s> to `store`.\n- Some tests are rewritten for clarity, focus and edge cases.\n- Redux in examples is now aliased to the source code for easier work on master.\n",

This also makes `createRedux(reducer: Object | Function)` make more sense as the shortcut.\n\nI _think_ this supersedes #119.\n\nWhat's lacking:\n- Support for dispatch-level middleware\n- Tests\n- Updated examples\n\nIdeally I'd like to implement middleware API proposed in #120, but not inside `Redux`\u2014instead, we'd call compose inside `createRedux` helper. I think that divides their responsibilities better. Technically, I'd prefer the \u201cnew\u201d dispatch middleware to be implemented by wrapping the dispatch function and returning something like `{ ...redux, dispatch: composeMiddleware(redux.dispatch, ...middlewares) }` from `createDispatch(reducer, ...middlewares)`. This would match the wrapping approach suggested [here](https://github.com/gaearon/redux/issues/113#issuecomment-114049804) for implementing time travel, but on a smaller (and much more restricted) scale.\n\nIf somebody would like to re-implement dispatch middleware like I suggested above in this branch, please feel free to!\n\ncc @acdlite \n",

        "body": "This PR mainly does two things:\n\n1) Makes the dispatcher stateless. Side-effect-y, so not quite \"pure\", but with no local state. Instead, it is passed `setState()` by the dispatcher.\n2) `createRedux()` accepts `prepareState()` as the third parameter*, which is used to prepare the atom before being sent to subscribers. Akin to a global `selectState()`, but with a different name to avoid confusion (e.g. `prepareState()` does not have to return a plain object).\n\n*I don't like this as a final API, but we should discuss this more before introducing a breaking change to `createRedux()`.\n\nThese two changes allow custom dispatchers to store \"meta\" state on the state atom without exposing it to consumers. https://github.com/gaearon/redux/issues/113\n\nIt also changes the signature of the dispatcher (by which I mean the higher-order function that creates `dispatchFn()` \u2014 we really need to work on / document some of this terminology) from `dispatcher(initialState, setState)` to `dispatcher({ getState, setState })`. It does not include `dispatch` as suggested [here](https://github.com/gaearon/redux/issues/113#issuecomment-112602119), since that can be implemented inside the dispatcher instead.\n\n~~Speaking of which, the `createDispatcher()` API has been changed slightly to~~ I'll submit a separate PR for this, since it's not really related.\n\n``` js\ncreateDispatcher({\n  stores,\n  middleware: ({ setState, getState, dispatch }) => middlewares\n});\n```\n\nThoughts? I will update with better `createRedux()` API once we come to a consensus.\n",

For example, to use a middleware:\n\n``` js\n// Instead of this\ndispatch(action)\n// do this\nmiddleware(dispatch)(action)\n```\n\nMultiple middleware can be composed manually\n\n``` js\nmiddleware1(middleware2(dispatch))(action)\n```\n\nOr using the provided `compose()` utility:\n\n``` js\n// All are equivalent:\nmiddleware1(middleware2(dispatch))(action)\ncompose(middleware1, middleware2)(dispatch)(action)\ncompose(middleware1, middleware2, dispatch)(action)\n```\n\nThe `compose()` middleware may seem trivial, but it makes it allows you to easily compose an array of middleware using spread notation:\n\n```\ncompose(...middlewares);\n```\n\nBecause middleware simply wraps `dispatch()` to return a function of the same signature, they can be used completely within userland. However, for the most part, you'll want to apply them globally to every action dispatch.\n## Example of how to write middleware\n\nHere's a middleware for adding naive promise support to Redux:\n\n``` js\nfunction promiseMiddleware(next) {\n  return action =>\n    action && typeof action.then === 'function'\n      ? action.then(next)\n      : next(action);\n}\n```\n## Use cases\n\nUsually, they'll be used like schedulers. They can be used to implement promise support (a la Flummox), observable support, generator support, whatever. Or they can simply be used for side-effects like logging.\n## How this affects the core API\n\nThis PR does not break the default behavior of the existing API. For instance, while `perform()` has been re-implemented as middleware internally, it is the default middleware if none is configured by the user.\n\nIn the future, Redux may provide some additional middlewares for things like optimistic updates, but they will be completely optional and not enabled by default.\n## Why is middleware special? Why not simply tell users to provide a custom Dispatcher and call it a day?\n\n[Custom dispatchers](https://github.com/gaearon/redux/releases/tag/v0.9.0) are the way to go for advanced functionality like time travel and transactions. But middleware _is_ special because of a very important property: because middleware wraps the `dispatch()` method, it's inherently compatible with any dispatcher, regardless of implementation.\n\nStill, middleware is totally optional, and each dispatcher implementation can choose whether or not to support them. (At the global level, that is \u2014 middleware can always be used from the calling site.)\n",

        "body": "Goals of this PR:\n- Add a **single powerful extension point**\n- Allow both #55 and #6 to be **implemented in userland**\n\nThis PR **does not** try to solve middleware API or the middleware composition. Instead, it allows to implement #55 and #6 in the userland by **separating \u201cRedux instance\u201d (the state holder) and the Dispatcher.** By providing a custom Dispatcher, you can experiment with different composable middleware APIs without changing the core.\n#### New definitions\n\nThe **Dispatcher** is a function responsible for turning actions into state changes. Its signature is `(initialState, setState) => (action) => ()`. You won't use it directly, and will instead hand it off to the Redux instance.\n\nThe **Redux instance** is ignorant of how actions turn into state. It has no knowledge of dispatching, or stores. It is a facade for Redux, providing you `getState` and `dispatch`, and letting you specify an initial state for hydration.\n\nThe Redux library provides a **default dispatcher that implements the current behavior** with `createDispatcher`:\n\n``` js\nimport { createRedux, createDispatcher, composeStores } from 'redux';\nimport * as stores from '../stores/index';\n\n// Compose all your Stores into a single Store function with `composeStores`:\nconst store = composeStores(stores);\n\n// Create a Dispatcher function for your composite Store:\nconst dispatcher = createDispatcher(store);\n\n// Create a Redux instance using the dispatcher function:\nconst redux = createRedux(dispatcher);\n```\n#### The built-in Dispatcher\n\nThe default dispatcher looks like this:\n\n``` js\nexport default function createDispatcher(store) {\n  return function dispatcher(initialState, setState) {\n    let state = store(initialState, {});\n    setState(state);\n\n    function dispatchSync(action) {\n      state = store(state, action);\n      setState(state);\n      return action;\n    }\n\n    function dispatch(action) {\n      return typeof action === 'function' ?\n        action(dispatch, state) :\n        dispatchSync(action);\n    }\n\n    return dispatch;\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, `perform` is no more. **Now `dispatch` behaves exactly like `perform` used to behave** because that's what the Dispatcher does.\n#### Custom Dispatchers\n\nTo provide a custom dispatcher, just _don't use `createDispatcher`_ and pass your own function instead with the same `(initialState, setState) => (action) => ()` signature.\n\nIt doesn't even _have to_ understand the concept of Stores. It may do something completely different\u2014the only important part is that it has to translate the actions into the state updates.\n#### Convenience API\n\nFinally, this PR brings back a simpler convenience API for most people who don't need to customize the Dispatcher or the Store composition:\n\n``` js\nimport { createRedux } from 'redux';\nimport * as stores from '../stores/index';\n\nconst redux = createRedux(stores);\n```\n",

        "body": "@gaearon this is not a real PR (at least for now). I just wanted to try an actual real-world example by doing some data fetching and using `react-router` and get feedback from you.\n\nIt would be good if you can have a look if the setup of the components is actually correct. There are a couple of things that are not working yet (e.g.: navigating to post detail).\n\nI also have a couple of questions:\n- if I use the `connect` decorator I don't get any `props` that are passed to the component, the decorator just wraps the `dispatcher` and the related `store`\n- to solve this I'm using the `Connector` component, so I can manually pass down the `props` like this https://github.com/emmenko/redux/blob/80593cd5bbe391332f67ac2643ceead0217a976a/examples/containers/BlogApp.js#L21-L28\n- since `actions` have to be bound to the `dispatcher`, in case I use the `Connector` component I can only do that in the `render` method, causing to pass the `actions` to the dumb component (not the container) and call the action from there (e.g.: https://github.com/emmenko/redux/blob/80593cd5bbe391332f67ac2643ceead0217a976a/examples/components/PostList.js#L6-L8). Is that how it's supposed to be?\n\nMaybe you point me in the right direction? Thanks :)\n",

        "body": "# Composable middleware\n\nAttempts to address #6.\n\nCurrently, the dispatcher does not publicly expose its `dispatch()` method. Instead, it provides a `perform()` method that serves the same purpose, except if the action is a function it calls the function and passes `dispatch` as a callback. This is a clever way of supporting async action creators. However, I believe this feature does not belong in the dispatcher, especially not as the sole interface for dispatching actions. Conceptually, this makes more sense implemented as middleware.\n\nI propose that we remove the `perform()` method and export `dispatch()` in its place. `dispatch()` works the same way as before: it passes an action through the store to calculate the next atom, then emits a change.\n\nTo continue supporting async actions, and to provide an extensibility point for external plugins and tools, we can provide some common action middleware, a helper for composing middleware, and documentation for  how extension authors can easily create their own.\n\nAn action middleware is simply a higher-order function. It returns a function with the same interface as `dispatch()`. For example, here's how you'd implement the `perform()` method described above:\n\n``` js\n// `next()` is either the next middleware in the chain or the `dispatch()` method\nfunction callbackMiddleware(next) {\n  return action =>\n    typeof action === 'function'\n      ? action(next)\n      : next(action);\n}\n\nconst perform = callbackMiddleware(dispatch);\n```\n\nNow we can use `perform()` just like before:\n\n``` js\nperform(action);\n```\n\nOf course, things really get interesting when you compose multiple middleware together. Here's another middleware that adds basic support for Flummox-like async action creators:\n\n``` js\nfunction promiseMiddleware(next) {\n  return action =>\n    action && typeof action.then === 'function'\n      ? action.then(next)\n      : next(action)\n}\n```\n\nCombine this with the callback middleware we defined above:\n\n``` js\nconst perform = callbackMiddleware(promiseMiddleware(dispatch));\n```\n\nThis is very flexible. You can mix and match middleware, and even change middleware on a per-action basis. We should provide an interface to specify global middleware that gets applied to every action.\n\nLike we do with `composeStores()`, we can also provide a `composeMiddleware()` helper as a convenience:\n\n``` js\nfunction composeMiddleware(...middlewares) {\n  return next =>\n    middlewares.reduceRight((_next, middleware) => middleware(_next), next);\n}\n```\n\nHere's the above example, rewritten to use our \"higher-order middleware\" (hehe):\n\n``` js\nconst middleware = composeMiddleware(promiseMiddleware, callbackMiddleware);\nconst perform = middleware(dispatch);\n```\n\n@gaearon has a good example of how this compose function would work with interceptors (which are just functions that return middleware): https://github.com/gaearon/redux/issues/6\n\nYay!\n\nIn summary:\n- [X] Remove `perform()` method and export `dispatch()` instead.\n- [X] Rewrite `bindActions()` so the final parameter is `dispatch` rather than the dispatcher. (Minor nitpick: Also rename it to `bindActionCreators` for consistency. I made this mistake with Flummox and came to regret it quickly).\n- [X] Add `callbackMiddlware()` for async functionality previously provided by `perform()`. There's no `atom` parameter, because I don't think it makes sense: you can just pass the atom directly to the action creator. I rewrote the Counter action creator `incrementIfOdd` as an example. Also, I wasn't sure if this should go on the main export or not, so for now I've put it at `redux/middleware/callback`.\n- [X] Add `composeMiddleware()` util for easily composing multiple action middlewares.\n- [X] Rewrite examples, including `incrementIfOdd` and `incrementAsync` action creators. `incrementAsync` illustrates how to implement basic promise middleware.\n- [ ] Provide an API for global middleware.\n- [ ] Update README (if/when this is ready to be merged)?\n\nThoughts?\n",
