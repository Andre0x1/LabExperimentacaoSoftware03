This will include repos of which I am either 'owner' or 'member'.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the query parameter to the API request. I was able to confirm the behavior with GET API requests:\r\n- Default type - 'owner' - https://api.github.com/users/sudo-suhas/repos\r\n- Type - 'all' - https://api.github.com/users/sudo-suhas/repos?type=all\r\n\r\nI have not tested this locally but I am reasonably confident that this should work.",
