I will probably come back later and add some more of this.\r\n- Tried to remove any partiality from descriptions (like \"the best\" or \"a really good\")\r\n\r\nThere are also a couple of entries commented out that either say the resource is not that great in the description (than why have it?) or did not fit in the category that they were put in.
