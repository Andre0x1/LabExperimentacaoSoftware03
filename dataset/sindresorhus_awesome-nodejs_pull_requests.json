        "body": "[Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Define a schema, transform a value to match, validate the shape of an existing value, or both. Yup schema are extremely expressive and allow modeling complex, interdependent validations, or value transformations.\r\n\r\nYup's API is heavily inspired by [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi), but leaner and built with client-side validation as its primary use-case. Yup separates the parsing and validating functions into separate steps. cast() transforms data while validate checks that the input is the correct shape. Each can be performed together (such as HTML form validation) or seperately (such as deserializing trusted data from APIs).\r\n**By submitting this pull request, I promise I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/blob/master/contributing.md) twice and ensured my submission follows it.

Ts.ED help developers to build a Rest/Web application based on Express.js or Koa.js by using TypeScript decorators and common patterns. The framework is pretty simple to use, support many other frameworks/library/third party and his learning curve is fast.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is pretty complete and provide many examples to help developers to be ready to dev.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to support other web framework like fastify which allows to have a \"cross http frameworks\" framework (koa, express, fastify).\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for taking the time to evaluate my proposal,\r\nSee you and thanks again for your awesome work.\r\nRomain\r\n",

You're gonna hate yourself.\r\n\r\n`pg-mem` is another option, which:\r\n- Is easier to setup\r\n- Is faster: since it's pure JS, you dont have any network or booting overhead.\r\n- Allows you to introspect your queries\r\n- You can even inspect the parsed syntax trees of executed SQL, since [its parser is also open source](https://github.com/oguimbal/pgsql-ast-parser)\r\n\r\nSee [FAQ](https://github.com/oguimbal/pg-mem/wiki/FAQ) for details.",

Instead, you use the generated Prisma Client API as a type-safe query builder that returns plain JavaScript objects. Schema changes are synced automatically from the models in the Prisma schema to the database. \r\n\r\nModels in Prisma mean something slightly different to ORMs. When using ORMs, models are represented as classes. With Prisma, models are defined in the Prisma schema as abstract entities which describe the relationships between tables:\r\n\r\n```prisma\r\nmodel User {\r\n  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id\r\n  birthDate DateTime\r\n  email     String   @unique\r\n  firstName String?\r\n  lastName  String?\r\n  posts     Post[]\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel Post {\r\n  content   String?\r\n  post_id   Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id\r\n  title     String\r\n  author_id User\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrima schema's declarative nature is concise compared to imperative model definitions in ORMs.\r\n\r\nThe workflow with Prisma is also slightly different to ORMs. You can use Prisma when building new applications from scratch or adopt it incrementally:\r\n- Existing application (brownfield): Projects that already have a database schema can be introspected by Prisma to generate the Prisma schema and Prisma Client. This use-case works with any existing migration tool and is useful for incremental adoption. It's possible to switch to Prisma Migrate as the migration tool. However, this is optional.\r\n- New application (greenfield): Projects that have no database schema yet can use Prisma Migrate to create the database schema.\r\n\r\nAt its core is the Prisma schema which serves as the single source of truth for your database. \r\n\r\n",

Was created on June 13, so more than 30 days passed.\r\n\r\nI used the requirements list from contributing.md:\r\n\r\n* **If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list, argue how it's better.** tinyhttp both has TypeScript support out of the box and Native ESM module available. Express has neither, Koa only ESM support but a different API. tinyhttp has a much smaller amount of dependencies than Express because it tries to use native modules / JavaScript language as much as possible. According to [benchmarks](https://github.com/talentlessguy/tinyhttp/tree/master/benchmark#results), tinyhttp is ~2.5x faster than Express.\r\n* **Suggested packages should be tested and documented.**. There is a [0.X API](https://tinyhttp.v1rtl.site/docs) documentation, and the code coverage is 73% (I can cover it in tests more and then return back here in case it's not enough)\r\n\r\nLet me know if I missed anything (or if I did anything wrong)!",

For example, rubico's `map` will return a synchronous value when used with the synchronous `square`, but returns a Promise when used with the asynchronous `asyncSquare`\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst square = x => x ** 2\r\n\r\nconst asyncSquare = x => Promise.resolve(x ** 2)\r\n\r\nconst { map } = rubico\r\n\r\nmap(\r\n  square,\r\n)([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // > [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\r\n\r\nmap(\r\n  asyncSquare,\r\n)([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // > Promise { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor rubico, performance and interface are king. rubico is highly expressive, yet takes care that it does not leak memory. rubico does not have any physical dependencies, but the more complex asynchronous algorithms are heavily advised by stackoverflow. For example, the `map.pool` implementation is heavily advised by [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62037349/rubicos-map-pool-array-implementation)\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/a-synchronous/rubico/",

And last, it doesn\u2019t serve React to the front-end like many popular React-based static site generators, which is usually overkill for small sites.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really want to build this. If you\u2019d asked me a while ago, I would have said the last thing the world needs is another static site generator. But when I went hunting for a replacement to the aging [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) for my 10+ static sites, I just couldn\u2019t find anything that was even remotely close to what I was looking for. Every tool seemed to have Webpack\u2019s philosophy: infinite flexibility so you can do exactly whatever you want, as opposed to my philosophy: convention over configuration, so I can make my site and then go do literally anything else other than spending hours fiddling with configurations.\r\n\r\nI hope you think it\u2019s unique enough to add\u2014thanks for considering!\r\n\r\n**By submitting this pull request, I promise I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/blob/master/contributing.md) twice and ensured my submission follows it.

Seedgoose supports id reference. [**This is a killer**]\r\nWrite data file like this. The reference is automatically hooked and tracked.\r\n```yaml\r\njack:\r\n  name: \"Jack Peter\"\r\n  age: 20\r\n  posts:\r\n    - \"basicReact\"\r\n    - \"fundamentalJavascript\"\r\njones:\r\n  name: \"Johns Tony\"\r\n  age: 25\r\n  posts:\r\n    - \"advancedJava\"\r\n```\r\n```yaml\r\nbasicReact:\r\n  title: \"Basic React\"\r\n  content: \"Lorem ipsum ...\"\r\nfundamentalJavascript:\r\n  title: \"Fundamental JavaScript\"\r\n  content: \"Lorem ipsum ...\"\r\nadvancedJava:\r\n  title: \"Advanced Java\"\r\n  content: \"Lorem ipsum ...\"\r\n```\r\n2. Supports any file format including `json`, `js`, `ts`, `cson`, `coffee` and `yaml`. However this does not takes any hard disk space. It won't require additional package if you don't write file in strange format. It will throw error if corresponding package is not installed but you write file in that format.\r\n3. Gradually seeding. You can seed data gradually and update gradually. Seedgoose tracks the actual id and smart id reference. As long as the smart id doesn't change, seedgoose know what should be updated.\r\n4. Write data files, not seeding files. Making code base clean and easy to maintain.\r\n\r\n**Why including here?**\r\n1. This project has unique killer features and exists for a year and I used that in many projects. Not something under a month, nor yet another wheel under someone's ignorant self-confidence and time-wasting, life-destructuring work.\r\n2. This project is actively maintained by me. \r\n3. There must be a lot of people need this. But they cannot find this. I want to get more feedbacks from them, helping them seeding files gracefully instead of their own unextensible and poor quality implements. ",

It's written in Typescript and exported as Javascript with type definitions. The exported package has no dependencies.

Mailgun is a very powerful API for scheduling, and managing batches of emails. It's just an API though, so I built a CLI for it. Mailgun is free for up to 10,000 email sends per month, which is more than enough for most people and small companies.\r\n\r\nSimply sign up for a free Mailgun account, create your HTML email, point mailgun-mate to it, and fill in the rest of the details in the CLI or it's config file, select your recipients from an ordered list, and apply various optional tags.\r\n\r\nThe CLI shows you when the last emails were sent for any given recipient.\r\n\r\nI use this tool weekly for my own business and for organising conferences\r\n\r\n",

The user can inspect objects, get insights on the heap usage and inspect context of functions in the call stack after their process crashed. It is one of the few tools capable of doing proper post-mortem analysis in the ecosystem, and is the only one kept up-to-date with Node.js releases (the other tool is mdb_v8).\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n  - [x] Wait 30 days\r\n  - [x] Search previous suggestions before making a new one (extensively)\r\n  - [x] Tested and documented\r\n  - [x] Individual PR\r\n  - [x] Follows `[package](link) - Description.` format\r\n  - [x] Adds itself to the bottom of the category\r\n  - [x] Links to Github repo\r\n  - [x] Short & descriptive\r\n  - [x] Starts with capital and ends with .\r\n  - [x] Doesn\u2019t start with A/An\r\n  - [x] Checked spelling and grammar multiple times\r\n  - [x] Made sure editor removes trailing whitespace\r\n  - [ ] Doesn\u2019t mention Node.js \u26a0\ufe0f \r\n    - (I think the description for this tool needs to mention Node.js, but I can try to reword it to remove the mention if you want).\r\n\r\n\r\n**By submitting this pull request, I promise I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/blob/master/contributing.md) twice and ensured my submission follows it.

I created this library to make functional programming with promises easy. It has been accepted by the open souce [async-problem](https://github.com/plaid/async-problem) repo.\r\n\r\nIt's unique. There is [a functional async library using Future pattern](https://github.com/ramda/ramda-fantasy), but `bluebird-promisell` is using Promises. And is the only functional library for Promises. Another uniqueness is that, `bluebird-promisell` is built on top of bluebird in order to take advantage of bluebird's awesome performance. \r\n\r\nThis library has [test cases with 100% code coverage](https://travis-ci.org/zhangchiqing/bluebird-promisell#L431). I've been using it on production for half a year. \r\n\r\nFor more detail, please refer to [the library document](https://github.com/zhangchiqing/bluebird-promisell) and this tutorial [\"Functional Async Programming\"](https://github.com/zhangchiqing/bluebird-promisell/blob/master/tutorials/functional-async-programming.md). \r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing my PR :)",

I did that because while oboe can make HTTP requests, in node it is more abstract and able to handle any readable stream. In fact, I think a preferred interface is to make a request and pass the response stream to oboe. It's worth noting that on the browser side, right now oboe just has the ability to make the requests on its own, so it would fit into the HTTP section",

It also adds better browser support.\r\n\r\n#### How this project came about and why I think it should be on this list\r\nWhen I started developing in Javascript I created a small logging shim to wrap the console for situations where it was not available. When I started developing in Node, I tried a bunch of logging frameworks, but none satisfied my needs. So I modified my own library based on some new ideas I had seen and created [picolog](https://github.com/download/picolog). I have been using that for about a year. In this time I discovered some things that lead to ulog:\r\n\r\n1. I found that it's natural for the default log level to be INFO on Node, but WARN on the browser\r\n2. When there are lots of modules doing logging, you end up wanting to see only the messages from some of them\r\n3. I discovered the popularity of debug. It's named modules and filtering idea is brilliant, but I did not like the fact that this was purely aimed at debugging. I wanted something more general purpose.\r\n4. I stumbled on the author of `ulog`, a project started but never completed. He agreed to let me use the name\r\n\r\nSo I created ulog. I have been using it for a month now. I have some ideas to make it even better (mostly I want to be able to use it as an alias for debuug so I can force packages using debug to use ulog instead), but I feel it's already full-featured so I'll do that when the need arises.\r\n\r\nThe package has a test suite and CI integration. I tested it's predecessor on platforms such as Nashorn and with loaders such as require js to make sure it is truly universal and I've been personally using and tweaking it for a very long time.",

The API is almost stable right now.\n\nThe algebra package let also define custom groups and rings, I did not added it in the description to keep it shorter.\n\nComplex and Quaternion are implemented as composition algebras using the Cayley-Dickson operator over Reals, so also Octonion are implemented as well as Complexes over a custom field (for example using strings instead of numbers, if you find operators that respect the ring definition laws).\n\nI hope algebra can enter the awesome node list.\n\nThanks,\nGianluca.\n",

Binary message coding equal to JSON in structure.\n- define a neutral interface definition format\n  - basic parameters types: boolean, integer, number, string, array and map\n  - custom parameters: derived from the basic types\n  - interface inheritance - in case if only little extensions are required and the functionality still can be used through neutral interface\n  - interface import/mixin - define complex types once\n  - strict interface versioning and backward compatibility requirements\n- provide a concept of generic components for all-in-one or distributed-over-many-nodes project with no difference to invoking code.\n  - connection and credentials manager (Invoker CCM) provides dependency injection feature in fact.\n  - unified implementation for error-prone input message and parameter validation\n- add out-of-the box advanced parameter type and checking\n- support uni- and bi-directional communication channels\n- support \"blocking\" and non-blocking calls (no response expected)\n- support service-side callbacks\n- support transport and message auditing\n- integrate message security:\n  - optional [HMAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) for message integrity checking\n  - optional interface constraints like SecureChannel (requires secure network transport)\n- extendable authentication types\n- various fine tune options (e.g. timeouts), transport channel state handling, user-defined transport channel context/state variables etc.\n- still make it possible to implement not fully complaint client or server in any technology in just a few minutes. It is even possible to make calls with command line cURL/wget using HTTP REST-like integration.\n- fix uncertainty of REST and complexity of SOAP.\n",

The schema is not tied to the structure of the page you're scraping, allowing you to pull the data in the structure of your choosing.\n- Pagination support: Paginate through websites, scraping each page. X-ray also supports a request delay and a pagination limit. Scraped pages can be streamed to a file, so if there's an error on one page, you won't lose what you've already scraped.\n- Complex actions: With the PhantomJS driver, you can click on buttons, fill out forms, even login or signup before scraping the page. This allows you to scrape pages that require authentication like Facebook or Twitter.\n- Pluggable drivers: Swap in different scrapers depending on your needs. Currently supports HTTP and PhantomJS driver drivers. In the future, I'd like to see a Tor driver for requesting pages through the Tor network.\n- Adaptive output: Apply custom functions to format your content. This allows you to create RSS feeds or even HTML pages from your output.\n",

It is a JavaScript module bundler (like Browserify and Webpback) that also offers first-level support for the optimized delivery of vanilla JS, CSS, images, fonts and other front-end assets to the browser. eBay relies heavily on this tool for delivering optimized webpages for our Node.js stack so it is heavily tested and documented and very actively maintained. \n\nIt offers many different optimizations:\n- JavaScript/CSS minification\n- _Conditional_ dependencies\n- Async loading\n- Image compression\n- Automatic code splitting for code shared across pages\n- Fingerprinted resource URLs\n- CDN URL generation\n- Custom output transforms\n- URL resolving inside CSS files\n- etc.\n\nIt also has the following features:\n- Simple interfaces: CLI, JavaScript API and taglib (for [Marko](https://github.com/raptorjs/marko) and Dust)\n- Fast incremental builds\n- Supports both runtime and build-time optimization\n- Declarative dependencies and inspected dependencies\n- Generation of `<script>`, `<link>` and `<img>` tags\n- Line numbers are maintained for transported CommonJS modules (no need for source maps)\n- Gulp integration: [gulp-optimizer](https://github.com/raptorjs/gulp-optimizer)\n- Easily switch between development and production mode\n- Plugins to support various CSS pre-processors, template compilers and transforms:\n  - [optimizer-require](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-require): Node.js-style require for the browser (similar to [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify))\n  - [optimizer-minify-css](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-less): Minify CSS files using [sqwish](https://github.com/ded/sqwish)\n  - [optimizer-minify-js](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-minify-js): Minify JavaScript files using [uglify-js](https://www.npmjs.org/package/uglify-js)\n  - [optimizer-resolve-css-urls](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-resolve-css-urls): Replace each resource URL in a CSS file with an optimized resource URL\n  - [optimizer-dust](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-dust): Compile [Dust](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs) template files to JavaScript\n  - [optimizer-handlebars](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-handlebars): Compile [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) template files to JavaScript\n  - [optimizer-image](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-image): Get image info (including URL, width and height) for any image on both the server and client\n  - [optimizer-imagemin](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-imagemin): Minify GIF, PNG, JPG and SVG images during optimization\n  - [optimizer-jade](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-jade): Compile [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templates to JavaScript\n  - [optimizer-jsx](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-jsx): Compile [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) files to JavaScript\n  - [optimizer-less](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-less): Compile [Less](http://lesscss.org/) files to CSS\n  - [optimizer-lodash](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-lodash): Compile [Lo-Dash](https://lodash.com/) template files to JavaScript\n  - [optimizer-marko](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-require): Compile [Marko template](https://github.com/raptorjs/marko) files to JavaScript\n  - [optimizer-sass](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-sass): Compile [Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) files to CSS\n  - [optimizer-stylus](https://github.com/raptorjs/optimizer-stylus): Compile [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) files to CSS\n  - etc.\n\nAlso, this tools supports many of the features of Browserify (browserify shims, browserify transforms, etc.), so it is an easy transition.\n\nThanks for your consideration and thanks for maintaining this list!\n",
