Also, it is not documented that it might throw `NoSuchElementException`\r\n   and `IllegalArgumentException` for **coroutines-related** errors.\r\n\r\n2. `ServerRequest.awaitBody` might throw `IllegalArgumentException` for two different reasons, for serialization-related\r\n   errors and for coroutines-related errors.\r\n\r\n3. `ServerRequest.awaitBodyOrNull` should never throw as the signature indicates. The convention established by the\r\n   stdlib mandate that an operation with the name `xxxOrNull` returns `null` instead of throwing in case there is an\r\n   error.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nIntroduce APIs that address all the above.\r\n\r\nAdd `ServerRequest.awaitReceiveNullable`.\r\n\r\n- This API \"abstracts\" away the coroutine-bridging exception handling from the user\r\n- Throws only in case of serialization error\r\n- Returns `null` in case user is expecting the body to be \"missing\"\r\n\r\nAdd `ServerRequest.awaitReceive`.\r\n\r\n- This API \"abstracts\" away the coroutine-bridging exception handling from the user\r\n- Throws only in case of serialization error\r\n\r\nBoth APIs introduce a \"mindset\" that only serialization-wise can something go wrong, in other words, user input.\r\n\r\n**Extensions:**\r\n\r\nBased on these functions, the user can create their own function for a general catch-all and return `null` pattern\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunCatching { awaitReceiveOrNull }.getOrNull()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deprecations/Migrations\r\n\r\nDeprecate `ServerRequest.awaitBodyOrNull` which can be replaced with `ServerRequest.awaitReceiveNullable`, as\r\n**behavior** wise they are pretty close.\r\n\r\nDeprecate `ServerRequest.awaitBody` with not direct replacement, but promote the usage of `ServerRequest.awaitReceive`.\r\n\r\nCloses gh-30926",

This can be reproduced by running experiment 3 of the the [gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-validation-scripts](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-validation-scripts). For example:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n./03-validate-local-build-caching-different-locations.sh \\\r\n  --git-repo https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework \\\r\n  --git-commit-id ac11b03cd3c37121232d0b556fe642103179cdc9 \\\r\n  --tasks runtimeHintsTest \\\r\n  --gradle-enterprise-server https://ge.solutions-team.gradle.com \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: You should omit the `--gradle-enterprise-server` parameter if you have permission to publish Build Scans to https://ge.spring.io. \r\n\r\nIn the resulting Build Scan of the second execution, we can see [the r`untimeHintsTest` tasks were re-executed](https://ge.solutions-team.gradle.com/s/d7ult3lltgus4/timeline?cacheability=cacheable,overlapping-outputs,validation-failure&outcome=success,failed&sort=longest). Comparing the two builds, we can see [the two executions had differences in the `jvmArgs`](https://ge.solutions-team.gradle.com/c/wlrbfwpmj4lrw/d7ult3lltgus4/task-inputs?cacheability=cacheable,overlapping-outputs,validation-failure#vld65yjjwfmzw-jvmargs).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have made two extra changes to:\r\n\r\n- Evaluate the `-javaagent` parameter lazily \r\n- Remove the cross project task reference to the `jar` task of `spring-core-test`. See [Sharing outputs between projects](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/cross_project_publications.html) for why and how this is done.\r\n\r\nEach change was made in a separate commit.",

        "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, private (and non-visible package-private) init/destroy methods were not supported in AOT mode. The reason is that such methods are tracked using their fully-qualified method names, and the AOT support for init/destroy methods previously did not take fully-qualified method names into account. In addition, the invocation order of init/destroy methods differed between standard JVM mode and AOT mode.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses these issues in the following ways.\r\n\r\n- `AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.invokeCustomInitMethod()`, `DisposableBeanAdapter.determineDestroyMethod()`, and `BeanDefinitionPropertiesCodeGenerator.addInitDestroyHint()` now parse fully-qualified method names to locate the correct init/destroy methods.\r\n\r\n- `AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory` and `DisposableBeanAdapter` delegate to a new `MethodDescriptor` record which encapsulates the parsing of fully qualified method names; however, `BeanDefinitionPropertiesCodeGenerator` duplicates this logic since it resides in a different package, and we do not currently want to make `MethodDescriptor` public.\r\n\r\n- Init/destroy methods detected via annotations (such as `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`) are now invoked _prior_ to init/destroy methods that are explicitly configured by name or convention. This aligns with the invocation order in standard JVM mode; however, `InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet()` and `DisposableBean#destroy()` are still invoked before annotated init/destroy methods in AOT mode which differs from standard JVM mode.\r\n\r\n- Unit and integration tests have been updated to test the revised behavior.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #10614\r\n- #28083\r\n- #30654 \r\n- #30755\r\n",

dependency\r\n* Add the following Configuration and Bean classes\r\n\r\n**Configuration class:**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class DemoConfiguration {\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public DemoBean demoBean() {\r\n        return new DemoBean();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Bean class:**\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class DemoBean {\r\n\r\n    @PostConstruct\r\n    private void init() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Init DemoBean\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @PreDestroy\r\n    private void destroy() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Destroy DemoBean\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Modifications:\r\n\r\n* Uses the name of the method instead of the identifier of the `LifecycleElement` even if it won't solve the potential naming conflict but it is a more specific use case\r\n* Adds a unit test to illustrate the use case\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n\r\nThe init and destroy methods are called when starting the application (native image or with `-Dspring.aot.enabled=true`).",

        "body": "We've been working on startup performance internally and noticed bean post-processors in particular caused us a significant amount of class loading making lazy initialization of beans less effective due to their use of reflection causing quite a bit of early classloading.\r\n\r\nI wrote an internal extension to `MetadataReader` that gave us parity with reflection for our internal processor implementations. I noticed `org.springframework.context.annotation.ConfigurationClassParser` already uses a `ResourceLoader` aware cached reader, so we're reading all of the bean classes once anyway, and could make our bean post-processors `ResourceLoaderAware` and avoid repeated reading overhead.\r\n\r\nSeemed to me this would benefit you upstream, for instance, uses of `MethodIntrospector` like [ScheduledBeanLazyInitializationExcludeFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/main/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/task/ScheduledBeanLazyInitializationExcludeFilter.java) cause similar problems, loading hundreds of classes in the application I'm looking at:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1476\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-14 at 6 03 48 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1479220/231983186-d540de49-01e5-433d-8af7-e4224013df83.png\">\r\n\r\nFigured I'd run this by you upstream at this stage to get some feedback on what else would be required to get this landed so we're not maintaining a partial fork of this logic, and you can benefit from replacing reflection with class reading where it makes sense. I plan on taking tests I have here and roll them into the complete reflection vs classreading test suites you have, but was avoiding that work until I have some feedback that this is a direction you'd like to go in.\r\n\r\nWe've found using `MetadataReader` with `BeanDefinition` requires some boilerplate, that is less of a concern with reflection, so would be interested in if you think there should be something in `BeanDefinition` to do at least the \"real\" class name resolution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString beanClassName = beanDefinition.getBeanClassName();\r\nif (beanDefinition instanceof AbstractBeanDefinition) {\r\n        // Deal with generated classes\r\n\tAbstractBeanDefinition abstractBeanDefinition = (AbstractBeanDefinition) beanDefinition;\r\n\tif (abstractBeanDefinition.hasBeanClass()) {\r\n\t\tbeanClassName = ClassUtils.getUserClass(abstractBeanDefinition.getBeanClass()).getName();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\nif (beanClassName == null && beanDefinition instanceof AnnotatedBeanDefinition) {\r\n\tMethodMetadata factoryMethodMetadata = ((AnnotatedBeanDefinition) beanDefinition)\r\n\t\t\t.getFactoryMethodMetadata();\r\n\tObjects.requireNonNull(factoryMethodMetadata,\r\n\t\t\t\"No suitable factory method for beanDefinition for bean: \" + beanName);\r\n\tbeanClassName = factoryMethodMetadata.getReturnTypeName();\r\n}\r\nif (beanClassName == null {\r\n\treturn null;\r\n}\r\nMetadataReader metadataReader = metadataReaderFactory.getMetadataReader(beanClassName);\r\nreturn metadataReader.get().getAnnotationMetadata();\r\n```\r\n",

This issue was discovered in spring-websocket-5.3.13 but still persists in the latest code base.\r\n\r\nIf the **error handler is not set**, then there is **no problem** as the message is delivered to the client in this scenario. A reproducible example that illustrates this is the `DisconnectWithoutErrorHandler.test` found at https://github.com/alexjansons/spring-sandbox/blob/main/web-socket/disconnect-error/src/test/java/com/example/websocket/disconnecterror/ApplicationTests.java#L97.\r\n\r\nHowever **if the error handler is set to `StompSubProtocolErrorHandler`** class instance or the instance of extended class given that the latter does not implement it's own `handleErrorMessageToClient` method, the disconnect message transmission process faces the `IllegalArgumentException` exception in the aforementioned method. The exception is caught and then silently ignored in `SubProtocolWebSocketHandler.handleMessage` method, which results in no message being sent to the client. This case is covered in `DisconnectWithErrorHandler.test` at https://github.com/alexjansons/spring-sandbox/blob/main/web-socket/disconnect-error/src/test/java/com/example/websocket/disconnecterror/ApplicationTests.java#L83.\r\n\r\nA workaround for this issue is to extend the `StompSubProtocolErrorHandler` class for the error handler and re-implement the method `handleErrorMessageToClient`  so that it does not generate an exception. An example of this workaround can be found at https://github.com/alexjansons/spring-sandbox/blob/main/web-socket/disconnect-error/src/main/java/com/example/websocket/disconnecterror/Application.java#L24.",

The module is configured to emit a warning message when a `package-info.java` file is missing, rather than throwing an exception. In addition, suppressions have been added to prevent the `JavadocPackage` checks from being applied to packages outside of the `src/main` directory. These suppressions ensure that the module only checks the packages that are relevant to the project and prevents false positives from being reported.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Configure the [`JavadocPackage`](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_javadoc.html#JavadocPackage) Checkstyle module to require `package-info.java` files for all packages under `src/main`.\r\n- [x] Determine if it is possible to require that `package-info.java` files include null-safety annotations \u2013 for example, via Checkstyle.\r\n- [x] If it's possible to require that `package-info.java` files include null-safety annotations, configure the necessary infrastructure.\r\n- [x] Introduce missing `package-info.java` files with package-level Javadoc and null-safety annotations.\r\n",

Given that the PathPatternPredicate can be embedded within any number of boolean operators the save, evaluate, and restore operation was added in those predicates.\r\n\r\nThe solution I had was to introduce some additional classes which allow for the predicate to make changes. This is the `Evaluation` record which has the test result and whatever state changes should be done if the caller deems it so.\r\n\r\nOpen question: the PathPatternPredicate appeared to be the only implementation which updated the request, but do folks have state-modifying predicates out in the wild? It would appears physically possible, but at the same time against the `@FunctionalInterface` nature of the definition of RequestPredicate. So this _could_ break extant use cases, but those use cases are not necessarily _philosophically_ correct. Given PathPatternPredicate is internal (and \"rule breaking\" by changing state), I supposed internally we could support its rule breaking.\r\n\r\nThe existing RequestPredicateAttributesTests all pass still.\r\n\r\n~I only did the changes in webflux, but could port these changes over to the servlet functions as well later if this is accepted.~",

        "body": "I was doing some flame graph analysis and found that ReadOnlyHttpHeaders.entrySet() was a small hotspot in my codebase. I looked into its implementation and found that some care was taken in the past to fully copy over the entrySet to into a new and [properly ordered](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/23551) set. The main hotspot in my specific codebase was in BodyInserterRequest.writeTo() which was called every time I used the reactive WebClient. I found that the entrySet() could be avoided and replaced with a forEach with putIfAbsent. The putIfAbsent is particularly useful since in the primary implementation I found it has to hash/normalize keys only once instead of twice like it was doing currently:\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/b23316302d578694c6915d5fc9ef24b571110ffc/spring-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/util/LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap.java#L209-L223\r\nIn order to make sure the fast path is taken, I had to make sure the whole call chain avoided the Map class' default implementations (which use the slow entrySet() or a naive putIfAbsent). this allowed us to get to LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap's implementations. The forEach is optimized in LinkedHashMap as well. This foregoes the need to create entrySets and iterators (all with immutability) which saves memory allocations. Here is a stack trace from a breakpoint in LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap.putIfAbsent() (note how the fast path is taken):\r\n<img width=\"527\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082334/218911000-2f593677-5737-47cc-afce-77b04db5a087.png\">\r\n\r\nSome other minor optimizations were included: presizing list in MultiValueMapAdapter.addAll,  use forEach in implementation of MultiValueMapAdapter.addAll (this avoids that slow entrySet path)\r\n\r\nASIDE: I think I found a bug in the ReadOnlyHttpHeaders.entrySet(). It appears that it leaks a mutable value list. See the following code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nHttpHeaders src = new HttpHeaders();\r\nsrc.set(\"foo\", \"bar\");\r\nsrc = HttpHeaders.readOnlyHttpHeaders(src);\r\nsrc.entrySet().iterator().next().getValue().add(\"blah\") // this should throw since [\"bar\"] is should be unmodifiable.\r\nassertThat(src.get(\"foo\").size()).isEqualTo(2); // should really be 1?\r\n```\r\nThat code currently works, but should it? I have a fix, but I'll save that for a separate PR if you want.\r\n\r\nI can also look into adding forEach implementations in things like NettyHeadersAdapter later.",

However, the `spring-test` module is only supporting `@Autowired` for dependency injection.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to add `@Inject` support for `spring-test`. Since Spring Framework 6 still supports `@javax.inject.Inject` in addition to `@jakarta.inject.Inject`, this PR reintroduces support for `@javax.inject.Inject` in `spring-test` as well.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nThe following test passes:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.demo;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\r\nimport org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter.SpringJUnitConfig;\r\n\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\n@SpringJUnitConfig\r\npublic class FooTests {\r\n\r\n\tprivate final String foo;\r\n\r\n\t@Autowired\r\n\tpublic FooTests(String foo) {\r\n\t\tthis.foo = foo;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tpublic void beanInjected() {\r\n\t\tassertThat(this.foo).isEqualTo(\"foo\");\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Configuration\r\n\tstatic class Config {\r\n\r\n\t\t@Bean\r\n\t\tString foo() {\r\n\t\t\treturn \"foo\";\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if `@Autowired` is replaced with `@javax.inject.Inject` the test fails:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.demo;\r\n\r\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\r\nimport org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter.SpringJUnitConfig;\r\n\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\n@SpringJUnitConfig\r\npublic class FooTests {\r\n\r\n\tprivate final String foo;\r\n\r\n\t@Inject\r\n\tpublic FooTests(String foo) {\r\n\t\tthis.foo = foo;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tpublic void beanInjected() {\r\n\t\tassertThat(this.foo).isEqualTo(\"foo\");\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Configuration\r\n\tstatic class Config {\r\n\r\n\t\t@Bean\r\n\t\tString foo() {\r\n\t\t\treturn \"foo\";\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Error\r\n\r\n> org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolutionException: No ParameterResolver registered for parameter [java.lang.String foo] in constructor [public com.example.demo.FooTests(java.lang.String)].\r\n",

And since Page, Slice, etc. are the types that users use a lot, the above process will be more inconvenient.\r\n\r\nI tried to solve it by forking the Spring-Data-Commons module that owns the Page class, but found out that the access specifier of `AbstractKotlinSerializationHttpMessageConverter.serialize()` was private, so I considered making serializeInternal abstract method.\r\n\r\nIf PR is allowed, I think I can expect the following two effects.\r\n1. Expectations that can be extended by adding KotlinSerializationHttpMessageConverter for Page, Slice in Spring-Data-Commons Module\r\n2. Expectations that users can expand by creating and registering the necessary custom serializers in the project as needed\r\n\r\n**[Plan]**\r\n* I will add KotlinSerializeHttpMessageConverter for Page and Slice in Spring-Data-Commons module like the contents of [Comment](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/issues/2752#issuecomment-1368726749).",

To help speed up the time it takes to recreate files like dependencies, GitHub can cache files that frequently use in workflows.\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\nJava projects can run faster on GitHub Actions by enabling dependency caching on the [setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) action. `setup-java` supports caching for both Gradle and Maven projects.\r\n\r\nThe following example enables caching for a Java project with Gradle:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsteps:\r\n- uses: actions/checkout@v3\r\n- uses: actions/setup-java@v3\r\n  with:\r\n    distribution: 'temurin'\r\n    java-version: '17'\r\n    cache: 'gradle'\r\n- run: ./gradlew build\r\n```\r\n\r\n> It\u2019s literally a one line change to pass the `cache: 'gradle'` input parameter.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- [actions/setup-java#caching-packages-dependencies](https://github.com/actions/setup-java#caching-packages-dependencies)\r\n- [How to build Gradle projects with GitHub Actions](https://tomgregory.com/build-gradle-projects-with-github-actions/#5_Enable_Gradle_caching)\r\n- [Caching dependencies to speed up workflows | thearchivelog.dev](https://thearchivelog.dev/article/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows/)\r\n",

In this commit: [CorsInterceptor at the front of the chain](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/a0826a20c3dd9dfd31dae5f056754092cb04383f), the order of `CorsInterceptor` was adjusted to before all interceptors, but the processing logic of PreFlight was not adjusted.\r\n\r\nWhen a PreFlight request is sent to the server, if one of the interceptors in the chain returns false in the `preHandle` method, then the related CORS headers will not be added, causing the browser to judge cross-domain, even if we explicitly configure allowedOrigins, but in fact there is no cross-domain, but the interceptor abort the chain in advance and the PreFlight logic is not executed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nCORS related headers are added in the response of the PreFlight request regardless of whether the interceptor abort the chain.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nBrowser block CORS request because PreFlight request not responding to 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header. Browser console print: Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://server.com/users' from origin 'https://www.another.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\r\n\r\n**Added unit test:**\r\norg.springframework.web.servlet.handler.HandlerMethodMappingTests#abortInterceptorInPreFlightRequestWithCorsConfig",

This PR aligns the initial capacity calculation with the one from the JDK and thus fixes the contract:\r\n```\r\n\t * Instantiate a new {@link HashMap} with an initial capacity\r\n\t * that can accommodate the specified number of elements without\r\n\t * any immediate resize/rehash operations to be expected.\r\n\t * \r\n```\r\nI didn't add a test because it would access internals of `(Linked)HashMap` which felt pretty ugly and would probably need the internals to be opened. But let me know if I should try adding some.\r\n\r\nI should note that this probably makes other cases a tiny bit slower, because the size is sometimes 1 higher than before. But then again. The contract is specific about the resizing not happening.\r\n\r\n(A backport to 5.3 is as usual highly appreciated ;-) )\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nChristoph",

        "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR has two commits: one that stops using `SynthesizedAnnotation` and a second that deprecates `SynthesizedAnnotation`.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to get rid of `SynthesizedAnnotation`, we can subsequently remove it completely for Spring Framework 6.0.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\n`SynthesizedAnnotation` was originally introduced as a convenience for easily detecting if an annotation had been _synthesized_ by Spring via a simple `if (myAnnotation instanceof SynthesizedAnnotation)` check.\r\n\r\nHowever, the introduction of `SynthesizedAnnotation` in the JDK proxy for an annotation results in a separate proxy class for Spring's synthesized annotations, and this causes issues with GraalVM native images since users and framework developers must always ensure that the additional proxy classes are registered.\r\n\r\nThis PR completely removes the use of `SynthesizedAnnotation` in synthesized proxies which allows the JDK proxy class for the annotation to be reused within a GraalVM native image. See [this project](https://github.com/sbrannen/graalvm-playground/tree/master/synthesized_annotations) for a demonstration.\r\n\r\nInstead of checking if an annotation implements `SynthesizedAnnotation` (to determine if the annotation needs to be synthesized), the PR uses a `Proxy.getInvocationHandler(annotation) instanceof SynthesizedMergedAnnotationInvocationHandler)` check to determine if Spring synthesized the annotation.\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks\r\n\r\nAt one point in 2015, @jhoeller used `Proxy.getInvocationHandler` to perform the \"is synthesized\" check; however, he reverted that due to #18402. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/18402#issuecomment-453434657 for details.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #18271\r\n- #18402\r\n- #29053 \r\n- #29054\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Determine if we can make `Proxy.getInvocationHandler` work without negative side effects such as those raised in [#18402](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/18402)",

        "body": "This PR provides two commits that improve `CookieLocaleResolver`, as a follow-up on #27609:\r\n\r\n1. **Simplify creation of `CookieLocaleResolver` with custom cookie name**\r\n\r\nAt present, creating `CookieLocaleResolver` with custom cookie name requires creating an instance using the default constructor and then using setter to configure the desired cookie name.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces `CookieLocaleResolver` constructor that accepts cookie name thus allowing for a simpler creation of an instance with the desired cookie name.\r\n\r\n2. **Refactor `CookieLocaleResolver`**\r\n\r\nAt present, `CookieLocaleResolver` extends `CookieGenerator` instead of `AbstractLocale(Context)Resolver` like other `LocaleResolver` implementations. This means it duplicates some common aspects of `LocaleResolver` hierarchy while also exposing some `CookieGenerator` operations, such as `#addCookie` and `#removeCookie`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `CookieGenerator`'s support for writing cookies is based on Servlet support which at current baseline doesn't support SameSite directive.\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors `CookieLocaleResolver` to make it extend `AbstractLocaleContextResolver` and also replaces `CookieGenerator`'s cookie writing support with newer and more capable `ResponseCookie`.",

So far this is the correct behaviour.\r\n\r\nA problem occurs when you're creating multiple instances of the MockHttpServletRequest with its content set to null. When getting the reader I would expect getting a new reader instance for each mocked request. This is not the case, since if the content is null, a reader instance stored in a static variable will be returned. This is a problem because once reader is used for the first mocked request, it cannot be used for the second mocked request because the stream used by the reader is already closed.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue I'm returning a new reader instance instead of using a static variable to always return the same instance. A unit test was added to reproduce the issue and to assert the fix is working as expected.",

While I understand the asynchronous nature of the client, it is also suggested as a replacement for the synchronous`RestTemplate` and still many uses of the client will be synchronous to a blocked `Mono`. In this context, it can make sense to use the Java IO API for streams which is compatible to many existing libraries for IO. In my case, this would also offer a simple starting point for migrating from `RestTemplate` and other HTTP APIs.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to use the client as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nWebClient webClient = WebClient.builder().build();\r\nString result;\r\ntry (InputStream input = webClient.post().uri(\"http://localhost:8080/hello/world\")\r\n    .body(BodyInserters.fromOutputStream(out -> out.write(\"Hello!\".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))))\r\n    .retrieve()\r\n    .bodyToMono(InputStream.class)\r\n    .block()) {\r\n  result = new String(input.readAllBytes());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is still work in progress, I am not overly familiar with the Reactor API, but the idea was that the streams would be read or written asynchronously while consuming them. This might also become a much more relevant approach once project Loom makes blocking a thread a more feasible approach where this simple approach might become preferable in some cases.\r\n\r\nWould you consider such an addition?",

Before, `AbstractNestablePropertyAccessor#processLocalProperty` threw `createNotWritablePropertyException`  when our class being deserialized did not have a setter on a property. This was then swallowed by `AbstractPropertyAccessor#setPropertyValues(org.springframework.beans.PropertyValues, boolean, boolean, boolean)` and binding of the next property was attempted. This is the wanted outcome. Now if this exception is not thrown (caught by the guard clause), we don't have default values on these fields so AbstractNestablePropertyAccessor#setDefaultValue throws an assertion which is not swallowed. Setting `ignoreInvalid` to false does cause `createNotWritablePropertyException` to be thrown, but it does not swallow the exception as before. This PR keeps the exact same functionality as now, but allows not having a default value for a property to be swallowed, in the same way it is in the other cases if desired. It also is a better way to handle the error and then throwing an assertion.",

Something like that:\r\n```java\r\nmockMvc.perform(get(\"/car/{id}/\", nonExistsId.toString()))\r\n        .andExpect(status().is(404));\r\n```\r\nAnd if our code in rest controller have bug, then test will fail with something like \"500 internal server error\"\r\nBut if we also make mistake in test in request's path, like that:\r\n```java\r\nmockMvc.perform(get(\"/carS/{id}/\", nonExistsId.toString()))\r\n        .andExpect(status().is(404));\r\n```\r\nthen test will pass and we don't catch bugs in cases when entity with given id is non-exists.\r\nSo, for this reason we used \"454\" as http status for \"not found\" case.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nIn our clients code we also write tests and want to cover this case with custom http status, but we cant because MockRestResponseCreators and MockClientHttpResponse not support custom http codes:\r\n```java\r\n  mockRestServiceServer.expect(requestTo(serverURI)\r\n          .andExpect(method(HttpMethod.GET))\r\n          .andRespond(withStatus(454)); // <-- will not work cause support only HttpStatus \r\n```",

        "body": "This pull request closes the issue mentioned here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/22609\r\n\r\nShort summary:\r\nA bean won't be created when it is being skipped by a condition for example when using `@ConditionalOnProperty` or `@ConditionalOnExpression` because the condition is evaluated to false. However a second bean with exactly the same name with different parameters may evaluate to true because the condition has met, so this bean should be created but that does not happen.\r\n\r\nAn example code snippet:\r\n```java\r\nclass Config {\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    @ConditionalOnExpression(\"${some-property-enabled} == true and ${some-different-property} == false\")\r\n    public ExampleBean baz() {\r\n        return new ExampleBean();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    @ConditionalOnExpression(\"${some-property-enabled} == false and ${some-different-property} == true\")\r\n    public ExampleBean baz(Object foo) {\r\n        return new ExampleBean();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `some-property-enabled` is false and some-different-property is true the second method should be called and the bean should be created, however this does not happen. The bean name is already in the to be skipped beans list.\r\n\r\nThe pull request contains the changes to reconsider a skipped bean when it encounters a new bean definition having a different condition. If it should not be skipped it will be created. The PR also takes into inheritance into consideration (for backwards compatibility, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/c263cbfbe486d7712b9e46b80ed151c1eda98c74/spring-context/src/test/java/org/springframework/context/annotation/ConfigurationClassWithConditionTests.java#L139)\r\n\r\nIn that specific use case the parent class defines a bean which should be created, however it is getting overridden by a subclass which defines a condition on the bean, so it will be created conditionally and may not even be created when it evaluates to false.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses a wrapper for the MethodMetadata as a helper class for resolving the inheritance with the condition on a subclass when it still needs to be skipped.\r\n\r\n### My use case\r\nIn my use case I wanted to refactor my code base.

I don't see a point in creating a second resolver class because it still does the same thing if there's no nested expression in the name, and there's effectively no penalty in simply checking `String#contains` every time.\r\n\r\nExample usecase:\r\n```java\r\n@Cacheable(cacheNames = \"schemas-#{#vendorId}\", key = \"#entityId\")\r\npublic Schema getSchema(String vendorId, String entityId){...}\r\n\r\n@CacheEvict(cacheNames = \"schemas-#{#vendorId}\", allEntries = true)\r\npublic void updateVendor(String vendorId, VendorDto newData){...}\r\n```\r\nHere, if I don't have SpEL inside cache names, I can only define a cache named \"schemas\", but whenever I want to update one vendor, I only want its cache to be evicted, not everyone's. An alternative is to manage the cache programmatically or implement my own cache resolver.",

Like `@Validated` annotation with Request scope Controller like bellow\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Annnotation definition\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n@Target(ElementType.TYPE)\r\n@Documented\r\n@Controller\r\n@Scope(WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST)\r\n@RequestMapping(method = { RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.HEAD })\r\n@Transactional\r\n@Validated\r\npublic @interface MyController {\r\n}\r\n\r\n@MyController\r\npublic class RootController {\r\n    @ModelAttribute(\"requireJs\")\r\n    public boolean isRequireJs() {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @RequestMapping(\"/search\")\r\n    public String search(\r\n        Model model, \r\n        @RequestParam(value = \"space\", required = false) @Max(value=100) String space) {\r\n        // ommit\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Aop class definition cache won't work well, therefore memory leak\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nthis bug is intruced by:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/26017/files#diff-8b811560ae60c9f7937f0d378880f1b4366fa67ea7024db018931a26e3b449edL370-L376\r\n- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/26017/files#diff-dd90aa36a7221a652e04631ac19dcb6693a9c841e43a90d36cc3caa51121630eL945-L947\r\n\r\n1. Because `@Validated` annotation added,\r\n`AbstractAdvisingBeanPostProcessor#postProcessAfterInitialization` add advice for `@Validated`\r\n\r\n2. Before https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/26017/,\r\ncache in org.springframework.cglib.core.AbstractClassGenerator  works well.\r\nBecause org.springframework.aop.framework.AdvisedSupport#getConfigurationOnlyCopy\r\ncopy org.springframework.aop.framework.AdvisedSupport#advisorsArray for create copy instance.\r\n\r\nBut after https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/pull/26017/,\r\nuse same reference of org.springframework.aop.framework.AdvisedSupport#advisors for \r\ncreate copy instance. and this advitors field update by AbstractAdvisingBeanPostProcessor#postProcessAfterInitialization\r\n\r\n3. When Create Aop class instance, try to reuse cache for class definition\r\n\r\nCache key is defined below code:\r\n\r\n- org.springframework.cglib.proxy.Enhancer#createClass\r\n- org.springframework.cglib.proxy.Enhancer#createHelper\r\n\r\norg.springframework.cglib.proxy.Enhancer#filter is registered at\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-aop/src/main/java/org/springframework/aop/framework/CglibAopProxy.java#L201-L202\r\n\r\n4. cache miss for class definition, memory leak happen\r\nAt AbstractAdvisingBeanPostProcessor#postProcessAfterInitialization, advice object\r\nupdated and therefore cache key is pollute, cache miss and memory leak happen.\r\n![memoryleak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625124/132629010-389ed075-05ba-427d-85aa-cd4900b618b8.png)\r\n\r\nSo, When creating copy instance on org.springframework.aop.framework.AdvisedSupport#getConfigurationOnlyCopy,\r\nIt is good that create new instance of ArrayList and copy all advices.\r\n\r\nThis bug reported by @hikoma Thanks!",

It is not possible to declare a script or inline statement to be run once before any test method has been run or after all test methods have been run.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it possible by adding two additional execution phases, `BEFORE_TEST_CLASS` and `AFTER_TEST_CLASS`. Scripts or inline statements with `BEFORE_TEST_CLASS` will be run once before any test method has been started. Anything marked with `AFTER_TEST_CLASS` will be run after all test methods have been completed.\r\n\r\n#1835 added `MergeMode`. `MergeMode` allows method-level `@Sql` annotations to override or extend class-level `@Sql` annotations. In my proposal, `MergeMode` has no effect on `@Sql` annotations with an execution phase of `BEFORE_TEST_CLASS` or `AFTER_TEST_CLASS`. The reason is that any method-level processing would come too late to influence a script or inline statement that runs when the test context is being set up. Furthermore, it would pose the question how to resolve conflicting annotations. If one test method wished to override a class-level `BEFORE_TEST_CLASS` annotation while others would not, honoring that wish would effectively turn `BEFORE_TEST_CLASS` into `BEFORE_TEST_METHOD`. `AFTER_TEST_CLASS` has roughly the same problem, just backwards.\r\n",

This enables the\r\nreactive API to use all the existing non-reactive request and\r\nresponse verification components without having to duplicate the\r\nentire API.\r\n\r\nWebClientUtils in WebFlux has had to be updated to exclude Error\r\ntypes from the filter, otherwise AssertionErrors always end up\r\nbeing filtered out by the ExchangeFunctions conduit. I don't believe\r\nthis should be an issue though, as the JavaDoc for Error types\r\nstates that \"no reasonable application should try to catch these\r\ntypes\", which means that the ExchangeFunctions probably shouldn't\r\nhave been allowing this through in the first place. Applied de-Morgans\r\nlaw to reduce the complexity of the expression a little.\r\n\r\nThe API itself attempts to be as similar to MockRestServiceServer as\r\npossible. For example:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval server = MockReactiveRestServiceServer.createServer()\r\nval client = server.createWebClient()\r\nval responseHeaders = HttpHeaders()\r\n\r\nresponseHeaders.add(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)\r\n\r\nserver\r\n    .expect(requestTo(\"/actuator/health\"))\r\n    .andExpect(method(HttpMethod.GET))\r\n    .andExpect(header(HttpHeaders.ACCEPT, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE))\r\n    .andRespond(withSuccess()\r\n        .headers(responseHeaders)\r\n        .body(\"\"\"{\"status\": \"UP\"}\"\"\"))\r\n\r\nStepVerifier\r\n    .create(client.get().uri(\"/actuator/health\").retrieve().bodyToMono(String.class))\r\n    .assertNext { assertThat(it).isEqualTo(\"\"\"{\"status\": \"UP\"}\"\"\") }\r\n    .verify()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that contributions such as this are not considered out of place,\r\nor anything. If this is in the wrong place, please let me know!\r\n\r\nLikewise if there are any other suggestions or feedback, I'd be happy\r\nto take those into account!",

Therefore,\r\nmy assumption has been that this is a potential bug as a result.\r\n\r\nThe issue itself appears to be being caused by the body processing throwing the exception rather than\r\nthe call to `exchange()` itself. On bodiless entities this appears to defer to be lazy, and the reactor client\r\nitself also appears to be only reporting the malformed chunks after the body has been processed, which\r\nmeant that the existing error handling in ExchangeFunctions was not being hit for these cases.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, the OKHTTP3 Mock Web Server is not chunking responses properly in such a way\r\nthat I could simulate this in integration tests, so I resorted to writing a simple thread with a ServerSocket\r\nto simulate the same issue. If anyone can think of a nicer way of achieving this, I will be happy to replace\r\nit, but for now it appears to cover that test case.\r\n\r\nI have also expanded the new test pack that was added on the 8th for WebClient integration tests to\r\ncover a couple of other test cases that I was performing on an in-house project in the company I work\r\nfor that also appear to not have existing cases yet. These are handling scenarios where the server closes\r\nthe socket before the response has been sent or midway through the request being received. These cases\r\npassed already but I added them just to be certain that no other regressions were added in this error\r\nhandling flow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am not aware of any issues that cover this already, but I may have missed some. I did take the time to try\r\nand find any that may reference something related to this, but if I have missed anything I will update the \r\nPR accordingly.\r\n\r\nHope what I have added is all okay, as I have only ever contributed documentation changes before now. If\r\nthere is any feedback or anyone can think of a better way to resolve this; or if there is any reason for this\r\nbehavior needing to be left how it is, please let me know!",

This is a refactoring suggestion that simplifies test design by eliminating a repetition structure whose increment was not being used during the repetition and can be replaced by an annotation.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nThe `@RepeatedTest` annotation provides the total number of repetitions desired. Each invocation of a repeated test behaves like the execution of a regular `@Test` method with full support for the same lifecycle callbacks and extensions, which improves test design, eases future maintenance activities when needed, and better informs which repetition failed.",

Problem Describe**\r\nI found spring will proxy some classes without the designated annotation , when I use @target in the pointcut expression.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    //this is my annotation\r\n    @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    public @interface PrivilegeCheck {\r\n        int[] roleTypes() default {};\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //this is my aop \r\n    @Component\r\n    @Aspect\r\n    public class AopTest {\r\n        @Around(\"@target(com.cxh.PrivilegeCheck)\")\r\n\t    public Object around(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {\r\n\t\t    System.out.println(\"before aop\");\r\n\t\t    return joinPoint.proceed();\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //this is my target class\r\n    @Component\r\n    @PrivilegeCheck\r\n    public class Father {\r\n\t    public int id = 1;\r\n\t    public int getId() {\r\n\t\t    return id;\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //this is a normal final class without @PrivilegeCheck\r\n    @Component\r\n    public final class FinalClz {\r\n\t  public int get(){\r\n\t\t  return 1;\r\n\t  }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe FinalClz class with also proxy, when i use the @target(com.cxh.PrivilegeCheck). But there isn't @PrivilegeCheck on the FinalClz class.  If FinalClz is not a final class, the problem just wast a little time. But if the FinalClz class is a final class, as we known the cglib can not proxy final class, so the project will start fail.\r\n\r\n**2. My Solution**\r\n    Because of the method findResidueInternal in ThisOrTargetAnnotationPointcut.class set the var  to shadow.getTargetVar() instead of shadow.getTargetAnnotationVar, the method visit(HasAnnotation hasAnn) of the SubtypeSensitiveVarTypeTestVisitor class in RuntimeTestWalker.class in the spring source code has an error.\r\n    So I use the method hasAnnotation(UnresolvedType ofType) of ReferenceType to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n",

It only adds the flexibility for customization which has been lost.\r\n\r\n#### Note [*]\r\n\r\nEven though `PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer` was also using a hardcoded class, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/01bea34569cd3dd00e8691a08ab1a2fc53d6c13e/spring-beans/src/main/java/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.java#L210\r\n\r\nIt's a private inner class, which even doesn't allow override. However, after several redirects, it eventually points to the `resolvePlaceholder` of the current class implementation\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/01bea34569cd3dd00e8691a08ab1a2fc53d6c13e/spring-beans/src/main/java/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.java#L250\r\n",

Currently there are two major problems about it:\r\n\r\n- we always allocate a buffer of the same size which is often several times bigger than actual amount of data being read from `InputStream`\r\n- we always return of copy of `byte[]` underlying in `ByteArrayOutputStream`\r\n\r\nUsing `InputStream.available()` we can pre-size the buffer in vast majority of cases and even when the whole data is not read within one iteration (for large `InputStreams`) we allocate as much memory as required. \r\n\r\nAnother optimization is about checking whether it was only one read from `InputStream`, and in this case the buffer itself can be returned instead of calling `ByteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray()`.\r\n\r\nI've used this benchmark available [here](https://github.com/stsypanov/spring-boot-benchmark) to check impact of the patch for start-up of simple Spring Boot application:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@State(Scope.Thread)\r\n@BenchmarkMode(Mode.SingleShotTime)\r\n@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)\r\n@Fork(jvmArgsAppend = {\"-Xms2g\", \"-Xmx2g\"})\r\npublic class SpringBootApplicationBenchmark {\r\n\r\n    private ConfigurableApplicationContext context;\r\n\r\n    @Benchmark\r\n    public Object startUp() {\r\n        return context = SpringApplication.run(BenchmarkApplication.class);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @TearDown(Level.Invocation)\r\n    public void close() {\r\n        context.close();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand got the following results:\r\n\r\n```\r\noriginal\r\n\r\nBenchmark                                                   Mode  Cnt         Score       Error   Units\r\nSpringBootApplicationBenchmark.startUp                        ss  200       718.760 \u00b1    20.549   ms/op\r\nSpringBootApplicationBenchmark.startUp:\u00b7gc.alloc.rate         ss  200        38.895 \u00b1     0.620  MB/sec\r\nSpringBootApplicationBenchmark.startUp:\u00b7gc.alloc.rate.norm    ss  200  49776228.720 \u00b1 19919.815    B/op\r\nSpringBootApplicationBenchmark.startUp:\u00b7gc.count              ss  200           \u2248 0              counts\r\n\r\npatched\r\n\r\nBenchmark                                                   Mode  Cnt         Score       Error   Units\r\nSpringBootApplicationBenchmark.startUp                        ss  200       614.820 \u00b1     7.031   ms/op\r\nSpringBootApplicationBenchmark.startUp:\u00b7gc.alloc.rate         ss  200        41.678 \u00b1     0.240  MB/sec\r\nSpringBootApplicationBenchmark.startUp:\u00b7gc.alloc.rate.norm    ss  200  49003403.920 \u00b1 21786.877    B/op\r\nSpringBootApplicationBenchmark.startUp:\u00b7gc.count              ss  200           \u2248 0              counts\r\n```\r\n",

Looking at the implementation I was able to identify some potential hotspots (e.g. LinkedList). The application is currently using Spring Framework 5.1.10 and I was happy to find that some of these issues have already been fixed in more recent versions of Spring.\r\n\r\nHowever there are still a few more opportunities to avoid memory allocations and copying of data:\r\n\r\n* Set a sensible initial capacity for lists and string builders: optimize for the common cases. We will sometimes allocate a few bytes more than required, but at least we avoid re-allocating the backing array. For the StringBuilder we need to iterate the collection twice to calculate the capacity beforehand. But iterating is a lot cheaper compared to allocating memory two or more times.\r\n* Re-use strings instead of concatenating their parts again: an earlier optimization introduced short-circuiting for a common case. We have computed the return value already before splitting it, so return it directly.\r\n* Do not concatenate with the empty string: Future JDKs might alleviate this, but at least with Java 11, `return \"\" + somestring;` is slower than `return somestring;`. Obviously it is more expensive memory-wise due to the construction of the newly resulting string.\r\n\r\nThis PR relates to and builds on #24674, #25650, #25552, #25553, and others.",

I would like to:\r\n- Manually test this fix\r\n- Add comprehensive unit tests\r\n- Understand if I am missing more places to fix this\r\n\r\nI have attempted to test this code form a unit test by calling out to a server that returns HTTP 100. I keep getting a socket error even though curl works on the same machine. Have you seen this before?\r\n\r\nAnd, how would you suggest I add uint tests for this. I know the netty server emits with this the proper header in the request. Should I spin up that server in case the mock server does not return a HTTP 100?\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\n[RFC2616 - HTTP 1.1 - Use of the 100 (Continue) Status](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-48)",

The problem is that trimLeading/TrailingCharacter and trimLeading/TrailingWhitespace methods create a StringBuilder object as a local var instead of using String.substring method. Such approach is leading to unnecessary object creation on every method invocation. Also it runs slower because of internal StringBuilder operations and conversions String->StringBuilder->String. According to simple JMH benchmark, substring is x2/x3 faster on avg scenarios. The situation with long strings that are not changed at all(if the method returns an equal string) is especially dramatic for StringBuilder (but substring will return its param instead of new a string creation)\r\nAlso found out that trimWhitespace(String str) method is already implemented in similar style.",

You can only do like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    public @interface Test1 {\r\n        String test1() default \"test1\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    public @interface Test2 {\r\n        String test2() default \"test2\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    @Test1\r\n    @Test2\r\n    public @interface Test3 {\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(annotation = Test1.class, attribute = \"test1\")\r\n        String test3() default \"test3\";\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(annotation = Test2.class, attribute = \"test2\")\r\n        String test4() default \"test4\";\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now, you can do this more easily:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    @Test1\r\n    @Test2\r\n    public @interface Test3 {\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(annotation = Test1.class, attribute = \"test1\")\r\n        @AliasFor(annotation = Test2.class, attribute = \"test2\")\r\n        String test3() default \"test3\";\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, the mutual aliasing of different attributes in the same annotation can break the original limitation (although this kind of use scenario is less):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    public @interface Test4 {\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test2\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test3\")\r\n        String test1() default \"test\";\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test1\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test3\")\r\n        String test2() default \"test\";\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test1\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test2\")\r\n        String test3() default \"test\";\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCombine examples above, you can use `@AliasFor` like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    public @interface Test5 {\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test2\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test3\")\r\n        String test1() default \"test1\";\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test1\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test3\")\r\n        String test2() default \"test1\";\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test1\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test2\")\r\n        String test3() default \"test1\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    @Test5\r\n    public @interface Test6 {\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test2\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test3\")\r\n        String test1() default \"test2\";\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test1\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test3\")\r\n        String test2() default \"test2\";\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(annotation = Test5.class)\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test1\")\r\n        @AliasFor(\"test2\")\r\n        String test3() default \"test2\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Target({ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    @Test6\r\n    public @interface Test7 {\r\n\r\n        @AliasFor(annotation = Test6.class)\r\n        String test3() default \"test3\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test7(test3 = \"override the method\")\r\n    public static class Element4 {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test3() {\r\n        Test5 test5 = AnnotatedElementUtils.getMergedAnnotation(Element4.class, Test5.class);\r\n        Test6 test6 = AnnotatedElementUtils.getMergedAnnotation(Element4.class, Test6.class);\r\n        System.out.println(test5.toString());\r\n        System.out.println(test6.toString());\r\n        assertEquals(\"override the method\", test6.test1());\r\n        assertEquals(\"override the method\", test6.test2());\r\n        assertEquals(\"override the method\", test6.test3());\r\n        assertEquals(\"override the method\", test5.test1());\r\n        assertEquals(\"override the method\", test5.test2());\r\n        assertEquals(\"override the method\", test5.test3());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details, please read `org.springframework.core.annotation.alisfors.AlisforsTests`.",

For example, the guide https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-messaging-jms creates a context with `DefaultMessageListenerContainer` + `CachingConnectionFactory`.\r\n\r\nFor that reason I assume that `DefaultMessageListenerContainer` + `CachingConnectionFactory` + dynamic scaling with `setMaxConcurrentConsumers` is correct.

Unfortunately, Spring WebFlux's\r\nequivalent class, the `ModelAttributeMethodArgumentResolver`, does not\r\ninclude these same extension methods. I am leveraging these extension\r\nmethods, specifically the `bindRequestParameters` method, to provide\r\nvaluable enhancements to my application. I would like to provide these\r\nsame enhancements to the WebFlux portion of my application and am\r\nunable to do so at this time. I would like to update the WebFlux\r\n`ModelAttributeMethodArgumentResolver` to add the `bindRequestParameters`\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nModifications\r\n-------------\r\nI created a new method called `bindRequestParameters` and encapsulated\r\nthe `WebExchangeDataBinder` bind call inside of it. This method is\r\nmarked as protected as it should only be used by children of this\r\nclass. This change mirrors the behavior in the equivalent Spring MVC\r\nclass (`ModelAttributeMethodProcessor`).\r\n\r\nResult\r\n------\r\nThe WebFlux `ModelAttributeMethodArgumentResolver` can now accept\r\nalternative data binding implementations mirroring the Web MVC\r\nbehavior.",

Rationale:\r\n- bufferisation anyway happens in `ClassReader.readStream()`\r\n- buffer sizes are different in `BufferedInputStream` and in `ClassReader.readStream()`: 8192 vs 4096 which means that `ClassReader.readStream()` has to do two calls to read full buffer of `BufferedInputStream`\r\n- most of the `InputStreams` returned from JDK classes are already wrapped into `BufferedInputStream`, e.g. `FileURLConnection.getInputStream()` or built around `ByteBuffer`\r\n\r\nI've used the benchmark to measure impact of this change:\r\n```java\r\n@State(org.openjdk.jmh.annotations.Scope.Thread)\r\n@BenchmarkMode(Mode.AverageTime)\r\n@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS)\r\n@Fork(jvmArgsAppend = {\"-Xms2g\", \"-Xmx2g\",

It is in `BeanUtils.instantiateClass(Constructor<T> ctor, Object... args)`. \r\n\r\nHere, the provided constructor object is made accessible before it is being used to instantiate the bean. \r\n\r\nThen, if the class that declares the constructor is a Kotlin class (and the `kotlin-reflect` jar is on the classpath; another prerequisite for this problem), the Kotlin `KFunction` object representing the Java constructor is obtained, and used to instantiate the bean.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when this Kotlin constructor is used, the accessibility flag that was set on the original Java constructor object is not set. This is because the original Java constructor object is not the same object as the Java constructor object that is buried deep down in the Kotlin constructor object, what you might expect.\r\n\r\nMy fix sets the accessibility flag on the Kotlin constructor object itself, in a similar way as it is done for Java constructors.\r\n\r\nI've added a test to `BeanUtilsTests` to ensure that a private Java class with a private constructor can be instantiated without problems. A few tests are added to `KotlinBeanUtilsTests` to ensure that this fix allows private and protected classes and constructors to be used.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to your feedback. \r\nRegards,\r\nTom",

Even worse, almost all standard smart post-processors are anyway returning null.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this PR is to hold an additional list of smart post-processors that can be used to minimize the iteration overhead in cases where only `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor` instances are of interest.

For those strings we can shortcut a bit earlier and save the overhead from `collectionToDelimitedString`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                          Mode  Cnt     Score     Error   Units\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew                               thrpt   10  2188,511 \u00b1  64,208  ops/ms\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew:\u00b7gc.alloc.rate                thrpt   10  2561,819 \u00b1  75,078  MB/sec\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew:\u00b7gc.alloc.rate.norm           thrpt   10  1536,000 \u00b1   0,001    B/op\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew:\u00b7gc.churn.G1_Eden_Space       thrpt   10  2558,410 \u00b1 141,016  MB/sec\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew:\u00b7gc.churn.G1_Eden_Space.norm  thrpt   10  1533,735 \u00b1  57,896    B/op\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew:\u00b7gc.churn.G1_Old_Gen          thrpt   10     0,002 \u00b1   0,001  MB/sec\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew:\u00b7gc.churn.G1_Old_Gen.norm     thrpt   10     0,001 \u00b1   0,001    B/op\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew:\u00b7gc.count                     thrpt   10   145,000            counts\r\nMyBenchmark.testNew:\u00b7gc.time                      thrpt   10    84,000                ms\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld                               thrpt   10  1345,572 \u00b1  52,746  ops/ms\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld:\u00b7gc.alloc.rate                thrpt   10  2264,133 \u00b1  88,387  MB/sec\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld:\u00b7gc.alloc.rate.norm           thrpt   10  2208,000 \u00b1   0,001    B/op\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld:\u00b7gc.churn.G1_Eden_Space       thrpt   10  2263,917 \u00b1 116,378  MB/sec\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld:\u00b7gc.churn.G1_Eden_Space.norm  thrpt   10  2208,212 \u00b1 102,736    B/op\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld:\u00b7gc.churn.G1_Old_Gen          thrpt   10     0,003 \u00b1   0,005  MB/sec\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld:\u00b7gc.churn.G1_Old_Gen.norm     thrpt   10     0,003 \u00b1   0,005    B/op\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld:\u00b7gc.count                     thrpt   10   158,000            counts\r\nMyBenchmark.testOld:\u00b7gc.time                      thrpt   10    85,000                ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\nCheers,\r\nChristoph",

It's opposite to the normal execution order of AOP function implemented by the XML.\r\n\r\nBy tracing and debugging, I found the reason is that the annotated methods is sorted by a wrong comparator which was not constructed correctly in the process of parsing annotations. Finally, the problem was fixed by adjusting the order of parameters (annotation classes) when the comparator be constructed. It was be verified after repair and compilation. So, I created this commit . If I misunderstand something, please tell me. thanks !\r\n",

        "body": "I'm working on an application that uses Spring caching and replicates cache entries across a cluster of hosts. When one host adds a new entry to a cache, it serializes that cache entry and sends it to the other hosts for them to add too.\r\n\r\nI noticed an issue where if an enum type is a part of the cache key the cache will not replicate properly. Each host winds up with duplicate entries in the cache for identical-looking keys.\r\n\r\nI traced the issue to the SimpleKey's hashCode field. It gets initialized in the SimpleKey's constructor and is based on the hash codes of all of the SimpleKey's parameters. The problem is that enum hash codes are based on object identity - they aren't consistent from one host to another and will even change with an application restart. If a SimpleKey instance was deserialized from another host and contains an enum parameter, then its hashCode field will have a different value than a SimpleKey with the same parameters created by the current host.\r\n\r\nThis means that even though the replication is working - each host is adding cache entries sent from other hosts to their own caches - no host can ever get a cache hit on an entry that was sent to it from another. The different hash codes make the cache's underlying map lookups fail to find the already-existing keys. The ultimate consequence is that these caches effectively have no synchronization across hosts and they're bloated with up to one duplicate entry per host for common keys.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the issue by making the SimpleKey's hashCode transient so it isn't shared with other runtimes when serialized, and by making sure its hashCode gets calculated by its own runtime even when the object was deserialized instead of constructed.\r\n\r\nI think this is a reasonable change because identity-based hashcodes are a real possibility in Java (it's the Object.hashCode implementation) and since SimpleKey derives its hash code from a set of parameters of unknown types you can't assume it's safe to share when serializing.",

The crux of the matter is that we are trying to ignore Range requests for streams whose content lengths cannot be determined, instead we do it in a roundabout way by excluding specifically InputStreamResource.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n- I have a custom InputStream that needs to ignore Range requests. It additionally needs to be lazily initialized (i.e. only when the Resource.getInputStream() is called). Its content length is unknown.\r\n- Cannot use any other Resource class other than InputStreamResource because they all will try accepting Range requests and when the content length is unknown, will throw 416s.\r\n- Cannot put the stream in InputStreamResource because of the lazy instantiation requirement\r\n- Cannot subclass InputStreamResource and override the getInputStream() method because the subclass will now accept Range requests and throw a 416\r\n\r\nThis PR excludes Resources with unknown content lengths from trying to do Partial Range support (which only results in 416s, instead of just a 200 with a full resource)\r\n\r\nA more complete redesign would allow the unknown lengths partial support, perhaps using \"*\" in the Content-Range header",

        "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhen I was writing custom `DeferredImportSelector` (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/pull/19400), I found an issue for handling `DeferredImportSelector.Group` with `@Order` on `DeferredImportSelector`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example to describe the issue:\r\n\r\nLet's say I have 3 `DeferredImportSelectors` with ordering specified 10, 20, 30.\r\nThe one with order 10 and 30 returns same import-selector-group(`GroupA`), and the one with order 20 returns different import-selector-group(`GroupB`).\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Order(10)\r\nstatic class DeferredImportSelectorA implements DeferredImportSelector {\r\n  @Override\r\n  public String[] selectImports(AnnotationMetadata importingClassMetadata) {\r\n    return new String[]{MyConfigA.class.getName()};\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Class<? extends Group> getImportGroup() {\r\n    return GroupA.class;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Order(20)\r\nstatic class DeferredImportSelectorB implements DeferredImportSelector {\r\n  @Override\r\n  public String[] selectImports(AnnotationMetadata importingClassMetadata) {\r\n    return new String[]{MyConfigB.class.getName()};\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Class<? extends Group> getImportGroup() {\r\n    return GroupB.class;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Order(30)\r\nstatic class DeferredImportSelectorC implements DeferredImportSelector {\r\n  @Override\r\n  public String[] selectImports(AnnotationMetadata importingClassMetadata) {\r\n    return new String[]{MyConfigC.class.getName()};\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Class<? extends Group> getImportGroup() {\r\n    return GroupA.class;  // <== same group with selector-A\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt might be arguable to use same import-selector-group in differently ordered deferred import selector, but it is possible to write that way currently.\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)\r\n@Import({DeferredImportSelectorA.class, DeferredImportSelectorB.class, DeferredImportSelectorC.class})\r\nstatic class ImportConfig {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `ConfigurationClassParser` parses this `ImportConfig`, I think expected order of returned `ConfigurationClass` are ordered by `@Order`:\r\n- `ImportConfig`\r\n- `MyConfigA` (from import-selector-A with order-10)\r\n- `MyConfigB` (from import-selector-B with order-20)\r\n- `MyConfigC` (from import-selector-C with order-30)\r\n\r\nHowever, currently it returns this order:\r\n- `ImportConfig`\r\n- `MyConfigA` (from import-selector-A with order-10)\r\n- `MyConfigC` (from import-selector-C with order-30)  <===\r\n- `MyConfigB` (from import-selector-B with order-20)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is because, when deferred-import-selectors are [sorted](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v5.2.2.RELEASE/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/annotation/ConfigurationClassParser.java#L769), it orders selectors to `selector-A`, `selector-B`, `selector-C` based on the `@Order` which is correct.\r\nHowever, when `Group` is processed, since `selector-A` and `selector-C` uses same `GroupA`, when `selector-A`'s group is processed, it also processes `selector-C`'s imports as well. ([here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v5.2.2.RELEASE/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/annotation/ConfigurationClassParser.java#L791-L793) uses group as key)\r\n\r\nThis would be a problem, for example, selector-B is spring-boot's auto-configuration and selector-A and selector-C are to be applied before/after auto-configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, in my patch, I have added `DeferredImportSelectorGroupingKey` for the `LinkedHashMap` that handles `groupings`. The key object also takes into account the order specified on import-selector.\r\nThis way, even same import-selector-group is specified in import-selector with different order, they are considered to be in different group and the one has higher order priority is processed first. Of course, same order with same group will be treated in same category.",

        "body": "**Affects:** 5.2.0.RELEASE\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this enhancement is that `WebTestClient` API is mostly blocking (with the exception of `.returnResult(Class<?>).getResponseBody()` which exits the chained API), and when it's used with Spring WebFlux it might be very common to get an exception because `reactor-tcp-nio-x` is a non-blocking thread.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to have another exchange method that is wrapped around a Mono publisher. This way the exchange can be executed within the reactive stream and the assertion API used in the `assertNext(..)` method of the `StepVerifier`.\r\n\r\nThis might also indirectly solve issues #21781 and especially #23390 since allowing the API to exchange within the stream will also allow the exchange to be in the same transaction. For example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test \r\npublic void account_test() {\r\n  accountRepo.save( // Create and store an account using spring-data-r2dbc and r2dbc-postgresql\r\n    Account.builder()\r\n      .username(\"mock\")\r\n      .password(\"1234\")\r\n      .build()\r\n  )\r\n  .publishOn(Schedulers.elastic()) // need to publish on an elastic thread or the blocking exchange will throw an exception\r\n  .as(TestHelpers::withRollback) // a transaction wrapper using TransactionalOperator and configured as rollback only\r\n  .as(StepVerifier::create)\r\n  .assertNext(saved -> {\r\n    assertThat(saved.getId()).isGreaterThan(0); // just to verify the account was persited on db\r\n\r\n    WebTestClient.bindToApplicationContext(appContext)\r\n      .build()\r\n      .get()\r\n      .uri(\"/account/\" + saved.getUsername()) // a simple WebFlux end-point that finds the account by username and returns it in the response body\r\n      .exchange()\r\n      .expectStatus()\r\n      .isOk();\r\n  })\r\n  .verifyComplete();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test will always fail because is running within a transaction. As the `exchange()` method is blocking, it will be executed in another thread outside the transaction, so the saved account will never be found. To run the end-point test within the transaction we need a non-blocking exchange method. In addition, it'll also remove the need to publish on a blockable thread.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for taking the time to review this PR \ud83d\ude42 \r\n\r\ncc. @sbrannen @jhoeller @mp911de ",

It doesn't matter if the report is delayed as long as it will be there when the system goes back online. With changes, you can easily handle this situation by finding last report date and creating triggerContext based on that time AND passing CronTrigger with argument fixedRate set to true.\r\n\r\nIt takes away burden of having to manually sync up on startup with custom logic (apart from finding last date), it prevents cases where you have rows with date 10.05, 11.05 and then 14.05, because new Cron fired task for day 14.05 but your catchup logic didn't finish yet the days between 11.05 and 14.05 (unless you write logic to handle \"holes\" between dates).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal String cron = \"0/10 * * ? * *\";\r\nfinal CronTrigger cronTrigger = new CronTrigger(cron, true);\r\n\r\n// quickly revert time by 1 minute for demonstration purposes\r\nCalendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\r\ncalendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, calendar.get(Calendar.MINUTE) - 1);\r\nSimpleTriggerContext simpleTriggerContext = new SimpleTriggerContext(calendar.getTime(), calendar.getTime(), calendar.getTime());\r\n\r\n// quickly prepare task for demonstration purposes\r\nThread task = new Thread(() -> {\r\n    logger.debug(\"executed scheduled for {} with scheduled time {}\", cron, cronTrigger.nextExecutionTime(simpleTriggerContext));\r\n});\r\ntaskScheduler.schedule(task, cronTrigger, simpleTriggerContext));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output for printing execution times will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-09-25 14:06:52.903 DEBUG 15336 --- [           main] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : Scheduling test cron 0/10 * * ? * *\r\n2019-09-25 14:06:52.905 DEBUG 15336 --- [taskScheduler-1] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : executed scheduled for 0/10 * * ? * * with scheduled time Wed Sep 25 12:06:00 UTC 2019\r\n2019-09-25 14:06:52.906 DEBUG 15336 --- [taskScheduler-1] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : executed scheduled for 0/10 * * ? * * with scheduled time Wed Sep 25 12:06:10 UTC 2019\r\n2019-09-25 14:06:52.906 DEBUG 15336 --- [taskScheduler-1] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : executed scheduled for 0/10 * * ? * * with scheduled time Wed Sep 25 12:06:20 UTC 2019\r\n2019-09-25 14:06:52.906 DEBUG 15336 --- [taskScheduler-1] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : executed scheduled for 0/10 * * ? * * with scheduled time Wed Sep 25 12:06:30 UTC 2019\r\n2019-09-25 14:06:52.906 DEBUG 15336 --- [taskScheduler-1] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : executed scheduled for 0/10 * * ? * * with scheduled time Wed Sep 25 12:06:40 UTC 2019\r\n2019-09-25 14:06:52.906 DEBUG 15336 --- [taskScheduler-1] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : executed scheduled for 0/10 * * ? * * with scheduled time Wed Sep 25 12:06:50 UTC 2019\r\n2019-09-25 14:07:00.001 DEBUG 15336 --- [taskScheduler-1] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : executed scheduled for 0/10 * * ? * * with scheduled time Wed Sep 25 12:07:00 UTC 2019\r\n2019-09-25 14:07:10.002 DEBUG 15336 --- [taskScheduler-1] project.scheduler.SchedulerService         : executed scheduled for 0/10 * * ? * * with scheduled time Wed Sep 25 12:07:10 UTC 2019\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur cron fired 6 times on startup - TriggerContext set to 60 seconds before \"now\" and CronTrigger set to fire every 10 seconds.

I'm not sure if changes didn't break some tests due to small edits in one or two interfaces (I tried to find all usages but I could miss some). I couldn't properly build project from source without excluding some tasks (-x test -x javadoc -x asciidoctor -x docsZip -x schemaZip -x distZip -x publishMavenJavaPublicationToMavenLocal). I tried to match the original code and style as closely as possible, I also provided some basic documentation for new things based on similar parts in classes. I needed this functionality and thought that making changes directly in Spring was the best way instead of writing custom logic, when most of it is already a part of framework. Adjust the code and add tests based on your preferences or needs.",

        "body": "The mail sending API is structured around the two interfaces `MailSender` and `JavaMailSender`, together with the class `JavaMailSenderImpl` which implements the two aforementioned interfaces. The numerous overloads of `send(..)`-methods in the interfaces makes it a bit cumbersome and errorprone to extend these interfaces directly.\r\n\r\nDefault methods introduced with Java 8 can to a large degree resolve this issue by moving from JavaMailSenderImpl to default methods in the interfaces. For methods which is \"piping\" to another method of the public API, this is a trivial refactoring (a820753). But `JavaMailSenderImpl.send(SimpleMailMessage...)` can not be refactored in such a trivial manner, as this method delegates to the internal `doSend`-method of `JavaMailSenderImpl`. To rectify, this pull-request also contains a suggested change to allow passing SimpleMailMessages contained in SmartMimeMessages further down the method stack, and allow the `doSend` to resolve the original message instances in case of errors, so existing behaviour is preserved. (f95659b168d479db3711d64ff02f533f437d0418)\r\n\r\nThe interfaces are now simpler to extend directly, and this also allows for more clean composable decorators, as demonstrated with the new `JavaMailSenderDecorator` class in 39724cdb0150b3894b23276bb1f287bdccc35af8. It \"seals\" the default methods as `final`, allowing decorating an arbitrary JavaMailSender with only overriding _one_ method, which is part of the public API. It is simple to wrap several layers of JavaMailSenderDecorators, if one should need to, and eventually end in a JavaMailSenderImpl.\r\n\r\nI have used this structure for a client to separately implement a whitelisting `JavaMailSenderDecorator`, and a performance monitoring \"aspect\" `JavaMailSenderDecorator`, which are composed together, and ultimately wrapping an instance of `JavaMailSenderImpl`.\r\n\r\nThis also may yield some advantages when testing, as one would only have to intercept the _one_ `send(..)`-method which is not provided by the interfaces, and tests does not need to know which overload is used by the main code. `JavaMailSenderImpl` instances can be separated strictly away from testing. For instance, if using mock libraries as Mockito, mocking a `JavaMailSenderDecorator`, it will ensure that all real `final` methods are invoked, and one may verify invocations of only one method regardless of which overloaded method is invoked by the main code.\r\n\r\nI hope this can be a relevant contribution, and I am very open for any feedback and discussion on this design! \r\n\r\nThank you :)",

        "body": "Previously, changing modules (snapshots) and dynamic versions were cached for Gradle's default period of 24 hours and `--refresh-dependencies` was used to pick up the latest artifacts. This approach has a notable downside. `--refresh-dependencies` causes all dependencies to be refreshed, irrespective of whether they are expected to change. At a minimum, this results in a HEAD request for every dependency in the build. Running an up-to-date build without `--refresh-dependencies` takes in the region of 6 seconds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew build\r\n\r\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s\r\n203 actionable tasks: 203 up-to-date\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same build with --refresh-dependencies takes almost ten times as long:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies\r\n\r\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL in 58s\r\n203 actionable tasks: 203 up-to-date\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces the manual usage of `--refresh-dependencies` on the command line with a 0 second caching period for changing modules and dynamic versions. This should remove the need to use `--refresh-dependencies` both locally and on CI, saving almost 1 minute per full build.\r\n\r\n/cc @etiennestuder",

The methods in that class are a poor fit for `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`, as they only support String-type values.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements and deprecates the methods that should not be used, and provides a new `convertProperty` that the configurer will actually call.\r\n\r\nI think a cleaner way to do this would be to make `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` not subclass `PropertyResourceConfigurer`, but I did it this way to avoid breaking the API.",

Which means any of the following ends with `400` - `?parentId`, `?parentId=`, `?parentId=garbage`\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- Generating URL using `MvcUriComponentsBuilder.fromMethodCall` doesn't work without the `OptionalUnwrappingConverter` I've provided\r\n- Without the fix in `RequestParamMethodArgumentResolver`, it generates empty query args - resulting in url with `?parentId` (without `=` and without value) - which is not valid and ends with `400`\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the correct way to fix this, so if you'll please give me some feedback on this, I'd be happy to add some tests.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRelated issue #16785  - it states that spring handles `Optional<?>` in handler arguments",

change the order of the code, and test it again(also run to 2000 qps), this time the cpu usage is no more than 35%, the cpu usage will not be affected by the length of `Accept` header any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I've left these commits in this PR as I figure they might be a useful reference.\r\n\r\nI've also used https://github.com/wilkinsona/spring-boot-benchmark-harness to check that there are no _major_ performance implications with the new code. The following shows the Spring Boot Tomcat sample application running against a baseline from c0ddaae5c0272af8b4eeb330bb8660da7411e99d.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMain method:\r\n\r\n|       | Baseline |  New  |\r\n| ----- | -------: | ----: |\r\n|       |    1.725 | 1.671 |\r\n|       |    1.731 | 1.680 |\r\n|       |    1.648 | 1.684 |\r\n|       |    1.684 | 1.775 |\r\n|       |    1.707 | 1.730 |\r\n|       |    1.667 | 1.722 |\r\n|       |    1.689 | 1.713 |\r\n|       |    1.691 | 1.737 |\r\n|       |    1.697 | 1.723 |\r\n|       |    1.688 | 1.725 |\r\n|  Mean |    1.693 | 1.716 |\r\n| Range |    0.083 | 0.104 |\r\n|  Diff =    0.023     \r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks should go to @wilkinsona who helped profile and identify several performance improvements.",

We've talked previously in #21548.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n* Adds more extensive tests for `SpringBeanContainer`\r\n* Fixes a bug where `SpringBeanContainer` would forget to autowire bean properties when a bean is requested by name (`org.springframework.orm.jpa.hibernate.HibernateNativeEntityManagerFactorySpringBeanContainerIntegrationTests#testCanRetrieveBeanByNameWithJpaCompliantOptions` was failing)\r\n* Fixes a bug where `SpringBeanContainer` would simply ignore the name when a bean is requested by name (the tests `org.springframework.orm.jpa.hibernate.HibernateNativeEntityManagerFactorySpringBeanContainerIntegrationTests#testCanRetrieveFallbackBeanByName*` were failing). If it was only about internal Spring behavior, it would be fine, but it also affected how the fallback producer was used. Essentially, whenever a bean name didn't match anything in Spring, `SpringBeanContainer` would first try to ignore the name, and if that failed it would call `org.hibernate.resource.beans.spi.BeanInstanceProducer#produceBeanInstance(java.lang.Class<B>)`, not passing the name to the fallback bean producer.\r\n\r\nNote that the fixes should not affect current setups, because Hibernate ORM currently never requests named beans,. The concept of named beans in ORM SPIs was added with future changes in mind, and is currently being leveraged in Hibernate Search 6 (still in Alpha).",

In this `Map` we want to save properties with property names which contain an index that is relevant for our application only, like `key5[foo]`.

That's because spring just looks for the first occurrence of `]` and thinks it's the closing square bracket of the property name, however in our case that square bracket is part of the property name, and the relevant square bracket for spring (to actually close the property name) comes afterwards.\r\n\r\n- [x] Added tests\r\n- [x] Signed the CLA.\r\n\r\nWould be nice if this could be backported to `5.1.x`.\r\nThanks!",

It will be at the discretion of each downstream project as to when/if they want to leverage the new incrementer.\r\n\r\nI am open to any feedback or changes you might want to make. I had toyed with requiring a platform transaction manager being injected into the incrementer (and creating a new transaction when the reaping interval was reached) as an alternative to using a thread, but I felt that was a more invasive change to downstream projects.\r\n\r\nI have also updated my little test harness to use \"copies\" of the incrementers I have submitted in this pull request: https://github.com/tkvangorder/jdbc-sqlserver-incrementer",

To avoid this I propose to populate `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap.segments` as local var and the write it to the field. Event if my assumption about HB is wrong reduction of interaction with fields helps us in interpreter mode.",

The media\r\ntype parsing operation is expensive and the result doesn't change\r\nbetween calls, since the request headers are immutable at that point.\r\n\r\nThis commit improves this by caching the parsed `MediaType` for the\r\n`\"Content-Type\"` request header in the `ReadOnlyHttpHeaders` class. This change\r\nis available for both Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.\r\n\r\nThe second one is linked to insertions/lookups in the\r\n`LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap`, which is the data structure behind\r\n`HttpHeaders`. Those operations are creating a lot of garbage (including\r\na lot of `String` created by `toLowerCase`). We could choose a more\r\nefficient data structure for storing HTTP headers data.\r\n\r\nAs a first step, this commit is focusing on Spring WebFlux and\r\nintroduces `MultiValueMap` implementations mapped by native HTTP headers\r\nfor the following servers: Tomcat, Jetty, Reactor Netty and Undertow.\r\nSuch implementations avoid unnecessary copying of the request headers\r\nand leverages as much as possible optimized operations provided by the\r\nnative implementations.\r\n\r\nThis change has a few consequences:\r\n\r\n* `HttpHeaders` can now wrap a `MultiValueMap` directly\r\n* The default constructor of `HttpHeaders` is still backed by a\r\n`LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap`\r\n* The HTTP request headers for the websocket HTTP handshake now need to\r\nbe cloned, because native headers are likely to be pooled/recycled by\r\nthe server implementation, hence gone when the initial HTTP exchange is\r\ndone\r\n\r\nIssue: SPR-17250",

The new `onStatusCode()` (`WebClient.ResponseSpec`) and `statusCodeError()` (`ExchangeFilterFunctions`) methods allow to specify exception function which should be applied on matching the status code (`int` value) against the specified predicate. The `StatusCodePredicates` provides convenient way to create predicates for these methods.\r\n\r\nhttps://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16819",

Without that, the underlying client\r\nlibrary cannot know when it is safe to release the associated resources\r\n(e.g. the HTTP connection).\r\n\r\nThis commit adds new `close()` methods on both `ClientHttpResponse`\r\nand `ClientResponse`. This methods is non-blocking and its behavior\r\ndepends on the library, its configuration, HTTP version, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the `WebClient` level, `close()` is called automatically if we\r\nconsume the response body through the `ResponseSpec` or the\r\n`ClientResponse` itself.\r\n\r\nNote that it is *required* to call `close()` manually otherwise; not\r\ndoing so might create resource leaks or connection issues.\r\n\r\nIssue: SPR-15920",

The type resolution consistency change is a significant (but really needed IMO) one that I would like to validate with @wilkinsona, @rstoyanchev, @poutsma and @bclozel.\r\n\r\nThe details of this change are in the 2nd commit message log and reproduced bellow:\r\n\r\n> Before this commit, Spring WebFlux used both the declared\r\n> return value type and the concrete object type in writers,\r\n> in a similar fashion than Spring MVC.\r\n> \r\n> But this can lead to inconsistent behaviors, for example between\r\n> type resolution of a return value that requires an adapter\r\n> (declared return value type is used) and one that does not\r\n> (concrete return value type is used) or between ? and Object handling.\r\n> \r\n> After this commit, only declared type (via return value type for\r\n> annotation-based programming model or ParameterizedTypeReference for\r\n> the functional API) is used in order to provide a consistent and\r\n> predictable behavior.\r\n> \r\n> The asynchronous nature of WebFlux, type erasure and providing\r\n> error-prone SPI are also reasons that motivates this change.\r\n> \r\n> Concretely that means that handler methods declaring an Object return\r\n> value type and returning a String or Resource value won't be handled\r\n> anymore by respectively by CharSequenceEncoder and ResourceEncoder.\r\n> These handler methods need to declare explicitly the return value type.\r\n> \r\n> For use cases that requires Spring MVC dynamic type resolution based\r\n> on the concrete return value type, using the functional API which allows\r\n> programmatic type resolution is the recommended way to use with WebFlux.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your feedbacks.",

I've changed getPathRemaining() to return not only the remaining path but also any variables bound in the part of the path that matched.\r\n\r\nI am submitting this as a PR because there are 'other tests' that are failing and I suspect some behaviours need altering to cope with the fact that trailing separators are auto matched now and I don't know 100% where all those places are.

I've marked them deprecated, but let me know if we should remove them.\r\n\r\nThis PR is currently WIP, because the test cases fail and need some more love.

        "body": "@smaldini brought this class to my attention and asked me to verify it. There were a couple of problems with the `AbstractEmitterSubscriber`:\r\n\r\n- Using a shared queue for items, error and completion signals. The problem with this is that if the user is in the business of processing `Exception`s as values, the logic may treat it as an error even if it came through `onNext`.\r\n- Since `onError` and `onComplete` are at most once events, there is no need to queue them up but could be simply saved in a field and read out in the emission side.\r\n- Now that the terminal events have their own fields, the queue can be simplified to an `AtomicReference` because this class requests items one-by-one.\r\n- It is unclear where the `onTimeout` body would trigger in respect to the regular signals, thus calling `emitter` directly from it is likely violating the serialization requirement of the emitter. The code now pretends to call `onComplete` which gets properly serialized with respect to any other signal.\r\n- In the handler method, if the `send` method crashed, the exception was not forwarded to the emitter for some reason. I assume the error should be reported since the source is otherwise cancelled and won't send any new item/signal.\r\n- Changed the `executing` to a linearizing atomic counter because the original CAS+Set based trampolining is generally hard to verify on not losing request for scheduling.\r\n\r\nI also kept the one-by-one nature and the rescheduling logic assuming the intent was not to \"cannibalize\" the executor if there was plenty of source items available and behave \"fairly\" with other tasks running on the same executor.",

It should be encoded as %40, but will eventually end up as %2540. The reason is that the MockMvcClientHttpRequestFactory will run .toString() on the URI before passing it over to the MockMvc request builder. The MockMvc request builder assumes that Strings are unencoded, and will (re-) encode the URI. Passing it as an URI to the MockMvc builder will skip that encoding step.\r\n",

The user was using a `RestTemplate` where our starter (without the user's knowledge) provided a `ClientHttpRequestInterceptor` that added an `Authorization` header. The user rather wanted to use a different authentication method and provided an `Authorization` header with a different scheme through an `HttpEntity` passed to the `RestTemplate`. I am avoiding this problem in our starter by calling `HttpHeaders#set(String, String)` instead of `#add(String, String)`.\r\n\r\nBut seeing that `HttpEntityRequestCallback` was copying over headers from the provided `HttpEntity` to another `HttpHeaders` object used for the request, I thought the intended behavior was rather to provide a fully mutable `HttpHeaders` for the remainder of the processing of the request, including any invocation of `ClientHttpRequestInterceptor`s.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this is a marginal use case at best, and could even be considered misuse of the API.\r\n\r\nIssue: [SPR-15066](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-15066)",

As a\r\nconsequence, all other types that deal with HandlerFunctions\r\n(RouterFunction, HandlerFilterFunction, etc.) had to change as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, when combining the above change with method references (a very\r\ntypical use case), resulting signatures would have been something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic Mono<ServerResponse<Mono<Person>>> getPerson(ServerRequest request)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich was too ugly to consider, especially the two uses of Mono. It was\r\nconsidered to merge ServerResponse with the last Mono, essentialy making\r\nServerResponse always contain a Publisher, but this had unfortunate\r\nconsequences in view rendering.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore decided to drop the parameterization of ServerResponse,\r\nas the only usage of the extra type information was to manipulate the\r\nresponse objects in a filter. Even before the above change this was\r\nsuggested; it just made the change even more necessary.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, `BodyInserter` could be turned into a real\r\n`FunctionalInterface`, which resulted in changes in ClientRequest.\r\n\r\nWe did, however, make HandlerFunction.handle return a `Mono<? extends\r\nServerResponse>`, adding little complexity, but allowing for\r\nfuture `ServerResponse` subtypes that do expose type information, if\r\nit's needed. For instance, a RenderingResponse could expose the view\r\nname and model.\r\n\r\nIssue: SPR-14870",

To summarise the issue, `MultipartHttpMessageWriter` follow the same design principle than Spring MVC `FormHttpMessageConverter`  : it creates a custom `MultipartHttpOutputMessage` designed to write the part headers in the body using existing `HttpMessageWriters`.\n\nUnlike `Flux<DataBuffer> Encoder#encode((Publisher<T> inputStream, ...)` which is a pure function, `Mono<Void> ReactiveHttpOutputMessage#writeWith(Publisher<DataBuffer> body)` API don't allow to get the transformed output to reuse it, so current implementation is adding `MultipartHttpOutputMessage#getBody()` with a hackish call to `Mono#subscribe()` in order to be sure that the `Flux<DataBuffer>` we retrieve is defined. That works (tests are green), but I guess that's not good in term of backpressure management and not very clean in term of software design.\n\nDo you see a better way to do this given current `ReactiveHttpOutputMessage` contract ?\n",

For relative request paths, those transformers would call\n`ResourceTransformerSupport.resolveUrlPath` with the resource path, as\nprovided in the original file. This can cause problems when a\n`CachingResourceResolver` is configured in the resolver chain, because this\nresolver is caching resources, deriving the cache key from the given\nresource path \u2014 this can cause collisions for cases like this:\n\n```\nresources/\n|--foo/\n|  |--foo.css (imports style.css)\n|  |--style.css\n|--bar/\n|  |--bar.css (imports style.css)\n|  |--style.css\n```\n\nThe first \"style.css\" resolved resource is then cached and will be given to\nany request asking for \"style.css\".\n\nTo avoid those issues, this commit improves the `ResourceTransformer`\nimplementations to calculate the absolute request path before asking the\nchain to resolve the resource URL, thus avoiding duplications. The resource\nchain will be then asked to resolve \"/foo/style/css\" or\n\"/bar/style.css\".\n\nIssue: SPR-14597\n",

I thought that this can ben done easily with a request post processor, whereas composing on a Publisher<DataBuffer> in an interceptor would be more complex. \n\nAlso, there are different ways to write the request body depending on the chosen semantics at the message encoding level: request.write(Publisher<DataBuffer>) versus request.writeAndFlush(Publisher<Publisher<DataBuffer>>). This make it harder to compose the request body at the interceptor level without making the API complex.\n\nNot exposing the request body in the interceptor may be a limiting choice in some cases, so that can still be reconsidered.\n",

        "body": "This pull requests add 3 tests to `AsyncTests.java`. They demonstrate testing of asynchronous request handling if controller returns an instance of `StreamingResponseBody`. This differs from testing of controller that return `Callable<?>` or `DeferredResult<?>` very much.\n## Background story\n\nWhile testing my Spring MVC application I came across your great examples of how to test asynchronous request processing using `spring-test` library in [AsyncTests.java](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/web/servlet/samples/standalone/AsyncTests.java) file.\n\nMy application however is designed to steam a huge amount of data and thus controllers return instances of `StreamingResponseBody` interface.\n\nUnfortunately the examples from `AsyncTests.java` did not work as expected. During second step after the `asyncDispatch(mvcResult)` method my expectations against `content()` always failed claiming that response is empty whereas I've expected some data to be written to output stream.\n\nIt took me some time to debug and figure out that the `asyncDispatch(...` method is actually returns back only the modified version of original request, and the `perform(...` method creates a new instance of `MvcResult` with a fresh version of `MockHttpServletResponse`. The logic inside controllers was writing the data into original HTTP response generated by initial `perform(...` method, while I was validating the content of HTTP response generated by second `perform(...`.\n\nIf somebody else is looking for a good example to test controller with streaming body, it would be great if they could find it in the source code of original library.\n",

The DefaultCorsProcessor uses the getAccessControlAllowOrigin function to check for the headers. That function in turn uses the protected function getFieldValues to build a comma delimited string. This function accesses this.headers directly, instead of using the get function which causes this problem, since ServletResponseHttpHeaders only overwrites the get function.\n\nI changed the protected getFieldValues function to use the get function which should fix the problem, but is a fairly trivial change.\n\nAs a workaround I registered the CorsFilter manually instead of relying on Spring Boots autoconfiguration (which uses an HttpInterceptor instead of a filter)\n",

        "body": "A new feature to include a response within another one. There are many questions on the web and stackoverflow about whether spring mvc supports this and as far as I know there is no default implemantion within the framework. \n\nASP .NET MVC provides this feature as \"Child actions\" and Grails also has this feature which we have used in many projects. While this is not a \"MVC\" related feature, it is especially helpful in MVC environments where a controller action view can include other helper actions. This is different than including partial views such that, this \"child action\"  can implement business rules or can query some database etc. This helps build more reusable sub components while separating controller logic and view logic. \n\nWhile this is possible by writing a custom tag to coordinate your business logic and separate it from the view logic, including a controller method response is more rapid, easier for the developer and view technology ignorant.\n\n**Usage**\nSay for instance a shopping cart summary is displayed on all pages by the \"CartController\" -> \"display\" handler method. Then the view developer will use it like this:\n\n```\n<s:include path=\"${s:mvcUrl('CC#display')}\" >\n  <s:param name='mode' value='summary' />\n</s:include>\n```\n\nAn example prototype project to show various usage scenarios and capabilities can be found\n[here](https://github.com/Rabbytes/spring-webmvc-include-example).\n\n**Implementation**\nI grabbed some part from Grails and some from Tomcat's  SSI filter implementation. \n\nCurrent implementation depends on StreamByteBuffer class authored by Graeme Rocher in Grails framework to capture the response in a in-memory buffer.Since this buffer uses chunks, it should be way more performant than a standard ByteArrayOutputStream especially for too many write operations.Graeme uses one byte buffer and one char buffer for write operations but I used byte buffers for both the printwriter and the outputstream.\n\nIncluded request has its own request params given to the constructor but if requested, it may also fall back to the original request params. Generally, this fallback is not a good choice because decreases reusability but in some cases, you find yourself copying request params from the main request to the child requests. For instance when displaying a product detail page, you may include child actions which all depend on the same product id. One way to do this is to set it as an attribute in the main request and allow child actions to get it. Fallback to main request params solves this issue but maybe an improvement can be to filter these params with a \"whitelist\" or \"blacklist\". \n\nAnother improvement may be to prevent child actions to respond to direct requests. In ASP .NET MVC you can define \"ChildActionOnly\" handler methods which can only be used within an include. Grails does not have this feature.\n\nAdditionaly in the future, we may put some kind of hierarchical state to the request attributes so that a handler method can check if it is working within a parent handler. This may help deciding on what and how to display based on the hierarchical handler stack. For instance, ASP .NET action exception handler uses this information when rendering exception response.\n\nAlthough I have some unit tests here, and I created a sample project to see this in action, I could not find a way to write some functional tests. \n\n**Example Project**\n[Example project on Github](https://github.com/Rabbytes/spring-webmvc-include-example)\n",

In the constructor of\nMappingMediaTypeFileExtensionResolver, the keys are converted to\nlowercase and the mappings of keys to MediaTypes are added to the\nConcurrentMap<String, MediaType> mediaTypes using the lowercase\nversion of the keys. However, when retrieving the MediaType from a key\nin the lookupMediaType method, no conversion to lowercase is performed\nso any value for the URL \"format\" parameter other than the lowercase\nversion will not return the proper MediaType result.\n\nOn May 1st, 2014, a change was made to\nParameterContentNegotiationStrategy to handle cases where the content\nnegotiation format URL parameter does not result in a match for a\nMediaType. If no match is found, a HttpMediaTypeNotAcceptableException\nis thrown resulting in the 406 response above. Prior to this commit, a\nnull was returned instead of throwing an exception so this issue was\nhidden and appeared to function correctly.\n\nTo make the media type lookup case insensitive, added a line to the\nlookupMediaType method in MediaTypeFileExtensionResolver to first\nconvert the extension (media type key) to lowercase prior to attempting\nto retrieve it from the mediaTypes map.\n\nIssue: SPR-13747\n\nI have signed and agree to the terms of the Spring Individual Contributor\nLicense Agreement.\n",

It provides an updated API, a few missing features, significantly [higher performance](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Benchmarks), and a [near optimal hit rate](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Efficiency). As the co-author of Guava's Cache, this provides an upgrade path due to Guava's being in maintenance mode, remains Java 6 for Android compatibility, and none of the current team members are familiar with the caching code. Prior to Guava I wrote a popular cache used by Cassandra, Grails, Solr, etc. called [ConcurrentLinkedHashMap](https://code.google.com/p/concurrentlinkedhashmap).\n\nFor an in-memory local cache, the benefits are more so in comparison to Ehcache. While the performance of Ehcache has always been fairly low, in v3.0.0.m3 the hit rate was dramatically reduced. Instead of taking a random sample, an MRU heavy distribution is sampled and then the priority strategy (LRU, etc) is applied. This leads to very a poor hit rate for small caches, raising to a random policy's hit rate for large caches.\n\nCaffeine's policy takes into account both the recency and frequency in O(1) time, retaining the popularity history by using a compact sketch. The concurrent throughput scales linearly (tested with 32-core) at 33% of an unbounded Java 8 `ConcurrentHashMap`. The implementation passes Guava's test suite, JSR166's TCK, and its own (consisting of over 1M test execution variants). There is about 95% code coverage and is well documented.\n",

        "body": "I was trying to implement a kind of router - retrieve a message in JmsListener annotated method, create a new message inside it (that basically embraces the request message) and send it to dynamically chosen queue, based on some processing logic. Unfortunately SendTo annotation doesn't allow for dynamic destination choosing and my incoming messages can't have ReplyTo field set. I've ended witch the following code, that works:\n\n```\n@JmsListener(destination = \"inbound.queue\")\n//@SendTo(\"Only static queue possible\")\npublic Message router(Message src, Session s) throws JMSException {\n    TextMessage dst = s.createTextMessage(((TextMessage) src).getText());\n    // based on some processing logic, we want dst to be placed in some queue\n    // This works, but is a \"hack\":\n    src.setJMSReplyTo(new MQQueue(\"some.queue\"));\n    // This doesn't work but is much more clean solution provided with this pull request\n    dst.setJMSDestination(new MQQueue(\"some.queue\"));\n    return dst;\n}\n```\n\nThere are some good reasons why modifying request (incoming) message is bad idea. First of all, it is good to treat inbound messages as immutable objects and not mess with changing their properties. Second, not all listener use cases are suitable for request/reply patterns. The original meaning for JMSDestination is informative one (to be used by receiving party to check what queue message originates from). Therefore message brokers ignore those properties when sending messages, while try to keep it informative on message reception. So reusing JMSDestination for hinting Spring Container about overriding SendTo annotation is not abusive and will allow to write a more clean code.\n",

Yet, the cache in GCS holds complex objects (keys), which in turn hold the aforementioned class object. Hence, with the proposed patch, it is possible that the `cache -> key -> class object` connection will get severed here:\n\n```\ncache -> key -> class object\n      ^\n```\n\nbefore the class object is being disposed of, while the \"correct\" loose link should be here:\n\n```\ncache -> key -> class object\n             ^\n```\n\nYet, I've looked at the problem for a couple of hours and don't see how we can do better.

        "body": "In `HttpMessageConverterExtractor.extractData` method, it loops for all `HttpMessageConverter` to return the converted result. This is correct but not perfect. Sometimes, it's not always possible to determine `canRead` with only 'return type' and `MediaType`. So my suggestion is, within the `for` loop, 'TRY' each `HttpMessageConverter` - I mean wrap the `return` statement within a try-catch. As I said, it's possible that one or more `HttpMessageConverter` `canRead` but in practice it `throws IOException`, then with the round robin loop, it may ultimately find the last one `HttpMessageConverter` which `canRead` and really convert the data into the expected return type. If none of them did the expected conversion, let `RestClientException` throw as usual.\n\nSo my suggested solution is:\n\n``` Java\n    public T extractData(ClientHttpResponse response) throws IOException {\n\n        MessageBodyClientHttpResponseWrapper responseWrapper = new MessageBodyClientHttpResponseWrapper(response);\n        if(!responseWrapper.hasMessageBody() || responseWrapper.hasEmptyMessageBody()) {\n            return null;\n        }\n        MediaType contentType = getContentType(responseWrapper);\n\n        for (HttpMessageConverter<?> messageConverter : this.messageConverters) {\n            if (messageConverter instanceof GenericHttpMessageConverter) {\n                GenericHttpMessageConverter<?> genericMessageConverter = (GenericHttpMessageConverter<?>) messageConverter;\n                if (genericMessageConverter.canRead(this.responseType, null, contentType)) {\n                    if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {\n                        logger.debug(\"Reading [\" + this.responseType + \"] as \\\"\" +\n                                contentType + \"\\\" using [\" + messageConverter + \"]\");\n                    }\n                    try{\n                        return (T) genericMessageConverter.read(this.responseType, null, responseWrapper);\n                    }catch(IOException|HttpMessageNotReadableException e){\n                        if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {\n                            logger.debug(\"FAILURE of Reading [\" + this.responseType + \"] as \\\"\" +\n                                    contentType + \"\\\" using [\" + messageConverter + \"]\", e);\n\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (this.responseClass != null) {\n                if (messageConverter.canRead(this.responseClass, contentType)) {\n                    if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {\n                        logger.debug(\"Reading [\" + this.responseClass.getName() + \"] as \\\"\" +\n                                contentType + \"\\\" using [\" + messageConverter + \"]\");\n                    }\n                    try{\n                        return (T) messageConverter.read((Class) this.responseClass, responseWrapper);\n                    }catch(IOException|HttpMessageNotReadableException e){\n                        if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {\n                            logger.debug(\"FAILURE of Reading [\" + this.responseType + \"] as \\\"\" +\n                                    contentType + \"\\\" using [\" + messageConverter + \"]\", e);\n\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        throw new RestClientException(\n                \"Could not extract response: no suitable HttpMessageConverter found for response type [\" +\n                        this.responseType + \"] and content type [\" + contentType + \"]\");\n    }   \n```\n",

This converter recognize `--optName[=optValue]` as _non-identifying_ argument with name `-optName` and value `optValue`. And if you want to use `JobParametersValidator` to validate requred and optional keys in `JobParameters` you need to check for `-optName` rather then `optName`. Or implement custom `JobParametersConverter` which will detect these arguments right.\nThis functionality is pretty common but there are no JIRA features or discussions in mailing lists.

(The end result is beyond what is possible using `headers` on `@RequestMapping`.) We then discovered `WebMvcConfigurationSupport` instantiates its own `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` in `requestMappingHandlerMapping()`, requiring overriding of that protected method to use our new subclass. \n\nThe existing `requestMappingHandlerMapping()` not only instantiates the mapping, but performs all of the default configuration of it. Initially, we copied that method intact into our subclass, replacing only the `new RequestMappingHandlerMapping()` with our own subclass. However, this duplicates the default config code in our code and exposes the possibility that we may miss changes to that config in future releases of Spring.\n\nWe did a simple refactor to extract the application of default configuration to into a separate method so overriders of `requestMappingHandlerMapping()` can simply pass their custom implementation into the new `configureDefaultHandlerMapping()`.\n\nExample override in `WebMvcConfigurationSupport` subclass:\n\n```\n@Bean\npublic RequestMappingHandlerMapping requestMappingHandlerMapping() {\n    RequestMappingHandlerMapping handlerMapping = new RequestMappingHandlerMapping() {\n        protected RequestCondition getCustomMethodCondition(Method method) {\n            // do custom request condition processing\n        }\n    };\n    configureDefaultHandlerMapping(handlerMapping);\n\n    return handlerMapping;\n}\n```\n\nIssue: [SPR-12746](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-12746)\n\nI have signed and agree to the terms of the SpringSource Individual Contributor License Agreement.\n",

        "body": "Adding a try/catch to print errors when JMX published proxies cannot get their target beans\n\nWe use the @ManagedResource and @ManagedOperation all the time.  Since most of our singletons are lazy when it publishes the managed JMX bean it creates a cglib proxy to register with the mbean server in order to preserve the laziness.  This is good.\n\nThe first time this JMX method is invoked, the bean is retrieved from the container and the managed operation method is invoked.  If anything fails in between the mbean server calling the proxy and the proxy calling our application code inside the operation -- the exception will go back through RMI and if the client is JConsole or JVisualVm then it will fail as the exception classes aren't on those classpaths.  It would be nice if spring would provide a way to enable logging in these scenarios.  \n\nThis PR adds a try/catch to log an error when the getTarget fails as would be the case here.  This would only affect generated proxies, which I think is a narrow change that doesn't seem to have any negative consequences.  When would you not want to log an error here?\n\nI have signed and agree to the terms of the SpringSource Individual\nContributor License Agreement.\n\nIssue: SPR-12399\n",

It would need to be.  \n- Although not required jamon 2.78 is the latest version so if it has to be added to your build file that should be used (it is in maven).\n\nHere is what the applicationContext entry would look like.  Note I disabled exception tracking by default so as not to change the current users behaviour (although I think having it enabled is a better default).

GsonBase64ByteArrayJsonTypeAdapter provides support to\nread and write Base64 encoded byte arrays, and can be enabled in\nGsonFactoryBean.\n\nRestTemplate will enable GsonHttpMessageConverter only if Jackson 2 is\nnot found on the class path, because by default GsonHttpMessageConverter\nsupports the same media types as Jackson.\n\nIssue: SPR-9488\n",

This is a\nbit of an issues because the `Blob` and `Clob` are out of scope for\ncalling code. `OracleLobHandler` also uses `Blobs` and `Clob`s are used\nwithout calling `#free()` but since the class is deprecated I did not\nupdate it.\n\nI did sign the Contributor License Agreement.\n\nIssue: SPR-11415\nhttps://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-11415\n",

There is already existing DEBUG logging before rendering the view, so it is a minor & sensible improvement to log any failure that then occurs.\n\nThis is logged at DEBUG level to avoid interfering with existing production logging, but provide necessary diagnostic information during software development/ engineering.\n\nDiscussing with Rossen Stoyanchev -- I note the other option of a flag in AbstractView or JstlView, but there is no very easy way to configure such a flag, since these are created from UrlBasedViewResolver, with limited knowledge of View subclasses & only partial coverage of View & Resolver subtypes. There is the possibility for the developer to define a bean-factory BeanPostProcessor, but this seems very  unlikely to be in effect by default.\n\nMy suggestion would therefore be to augment the existing 'DEBUG' logging in DispatcherServlet to include reporting View rendering exceptions, similar to how many other conditions (Controller exceptions & forwarding to error views, HandlerInterceptor exceptions) are already logged.\n",

One does that by configuring new\ntimezone attribute of @Scheduled annotation to ID of desired time zone.\n\nIssue: SPR-10456\n",

This caused build failures on Linux environments.\n\nIssue can be solved by packaging font with report, using JasperReports\nfont extension support.

The reason for this problem is that in chaining calls the compiler 'loses' the knowledge that the type being returned is actually a DefaultMockMvcBuilder and returns to the type specified in the 'extends' part of the generic type definition. By tightening the bounds of the generic type to 'extends DefaultMockMvcBuilder', clients of the class can continue to call methods on the returned reference and still have access to the DefaultMockMvcBuilder methods.\n\nA test has been added matching the original example in the Jira issue, which now compiles successfully.\n\nIssue: SPR-10277\n",

There is no support for using other\nrunners like Theories or Parameterized or 3rd party runners like\nMockitoJUnitRunner. A runner based approach does not seem to offer much\npromise as runners are not composable, a custom Spring version of every\nrunner has to be developed and maintained.\n\nWith JUnit 4.9+ the preferred way to implement such behavior is to use\nrules. Unlike runners there can be several ones of them and they can be\ncomposed. In theory TestExecutionListener could be deprecated and be\nreplaced with standard JUnit rules but this seems to be a bit on the\ndrastic side.\n\nThis proposed implementation is using both a class rule and a method\nrule. The class rule creates the TestContextManager, runs all the class\nlevel callbacks and class level checks. The method rule runs all the\ninstance level callbacks and method level checks. I did not see a way\nto implement the current functionality offered by\nSpringJUnit4ClassRunner using only one rule.\nUsing two rules has the advantage that the implementation is cleaner\nbecause it better separates the concerns. However it has the\ndisadvantage that it's harder to set up because both a method rule and\na class rule are needed. This also increases the potential for\nmisconfiguration.\n\nThe method rule has to be a MethodRule instead of a TestRule because\nonly the former has access to the test object with we need to perform\ninjection. This interface used to be deprecated once but doesn't seem\nto be anymore. This creates a certain risk that it will be deprectated\nagain and potentially be remvoed in the future. An additional drawback\nis that MethodRule unlike TestRule can only be defined in fields and\nnot methods. This is an unfortunate consequence of the implementation\nof org.junit.runners.model.TestClass. As JUnit does not do\nField#setAccessible(true) this means that tests will have to be defined\nin public fields.\n\nAnother minor issue is that tests not run because of IfProfileValue\nwill still show up in the Eclipse test tree, just blank.\n\nIn conclusion while the given implementation has some downsides I don't\nsee any other possible implementations given the current state of\naffairs in JUnit.\n- Add SpringJUnitClassRule for all the class level processing\n- Add SpringJUnitMethodRule for all the method level processing\n- Add tests for the rules\n\nSPR-10217\n",

Currently, they are only detected once\nthe Spring framework has been converted to OSGi bundles and these\nbundles have been tested with Eclipse Virgo.\n\nThis pull request adds a build-time check for split packages to the Spring\nframework build.

The concept of a \nvalue reference for an expression component has been introduced.\nValue references can be passed around and at any time the actual\nvalue can be retrieved (via a get) or set (where applicable). This\nwas needed to avoid double evaluation of expression components.\nFor example, in evaluating the expression 'somearray[index++]--'\nwithout a value reference SpEL would need to evaluate the\n'somearray[index++]' component twice, once to get the value and\nthen again to determine where to put the new value. If that\ncomponent is evaluated twice, index would be double incremented.\nA value reference for 'somearray[index++]' avoids this problem.\n\nMany new tests have been introduced into the EvaluationTests\nto ensure not only that ++ and -- work but also that the \nintroduction of value references across the all of SpEL has\nnot caused regressions.\n\nIssue: SPR-9751\n",

Since this is something that others would likely want, we thought it would be best to update the `MockFilterChain` provided by Spring Framework.\n\nOne item that should be highlighted is that the `doFilter` method signature now has throws `IOException`, `ServletException`. While both `Exception`s are on the `FilterChain` interface, this is non-passive for any user invoking `new MockFilterChain().doFilter()` since they would need to handle the newly added `Exception`s. However, since this is to only impact test code and is impossible to miss (due to the compiler) and easily fixable it was thought to be better than wrapping the `Exception`s with a `RuntimeException`.\n\nCurrently the MockFilterChain\n- Performs basic validation on the request/response\n- Makes the request/response available as members\n- Ensures doFilter is only invoked once\n\nThis commit adds the ability to allow the MockFilterChain to invoke\na List of Filter's and/or a Servlet.\n\nIssue: SPR-9745\n",

I think this is correct behavior but it could be preferable to do this in another JIRA. I did it in this one because I thought it was weird keeping the state in two distinct locations. Please let me know if you would like this changed.\n- [SPR-9594](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-9594) points out the spec states \"Sends a temporary redirect response ...\" Interestingly enough there is a constant named [SC_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/products/products/servlet/2.3/javadoc/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#SC_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT) that is equal to 307 (not 302 as we believe the status should be). I still think 302 is the correct status, but thought I would point this out. There are two constants for a 302 ([SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/products/products/servlet/2.3/javadoc/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY) and [SC_FOUND](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#SC_FOUND)) that have documentation stating it should be used for temporarily moved. The reason I brought up SC_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT is that it is an exact match of the spec.\n# Changes\n\nPreviously MockHttpServletRequest#sendRedirect did not set the HTTP status\nor the Location header. This does not conform to the HttpServletRequest\ninterface.\n\nMockHttpServletRequest will now:\n- Set the HTTP status to 302 on sendRedirect\n- Set the Location header on sendRedirect\n- Ensure the Location header and getRedirectedUrl are kept in synch\n\nIssue: SPR-9594\n",

It enables the kind of Validator class shown in the example in the last comment on the issue. \n\nThis code works great in a modified version of the PetClinic app I am using to test, by setting this AnnotationMethodValidator as the one system-level validator (i.e. by returning an object of this type from the getValidator() method of a config class that extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter).\n\nIf an approach to validation like this one makes sense, then the next question is how to register this validation mechanism with the framework. In my opinion, registering both a LocalValidatorFactoryBean and an AnnotationMethodValidator by default would cover most validation needs in an application, reduce the need to configure custom validators in ConfigurableWebBindingInitializers or @InitBinder methods, and bring validation more in line with other parts of the framework that leverage component scanning and flexible method signatures to make it easier for developers to extend the framework. \n\nUnfortunately, the concept of a single validator class goes pretty deep into the framework (through the Java Config extension points to the DataBinder). It seems like it would be much more flexible for an app to be able to register multiple validators, similar to just about every other extension point (formatters, message converters, argument resolvers, handler exception resolvers, view resolvers, resource handlers, etc...). I have started to make all the changes to support registering a set of validators and defaulting, but I would like to get guidance and advice that this is the right approach before continuing. \n",

It would be great if in the meantime at least a few of you could take the new build for a spin.\n\nEven if you don't get a chance to try it before Monday, merging into master will be low-impact, as everyone is focused on 3.1.x work right now anyway (3.1.x will remain permanently on spring-build).\n\nJust follow the instructions at https://github.com/cbeams/spring-framework#building_from_source, but instead of cloning a new repository as the documentation suggests, you can simply add me as a remote to your existing spring-framework repository and check out the 'gradle' branch there:\n\n```\n$ git remote add cbeams git@github.com:cbeams/spring-framework.git\n$ git fetch cbeams\n$ git checkout -b gradle cbeams/gradle\n$ ./gradlew build\n```\n## Documentation\n\nI would also appreciate feedback on these new wiki docs:\n- [Gradle build and release FAQ](https://github.com/cbeams/spring-framework/wiki/Gradle-build-and-release-FAQ)\n- [SpringSource repository FAQ](https://github.com/cbeams/spring-framework/wiki/SpringSource-repository-FAQ)\n\nNote that a lot of the information there is general and not specific only to Spring Framework, but I wanted to get all this down in one place for now.  We can think about hosting it somewhere more general later.  While these are written for a mixed audience of committers and end-users, I want to make sure that this is documentation that any project lead can look at to understand how things work, particularly with regard to release management.\n\nBasically, if anything is confusing to you, it should probably be in one of those FAQs.  Please let me know what questions you have as you try this out, and we'll get it in there.\n",

Take a look at the \"Review\" commit 319d8566 to see what I've already updated.\n\nA few open questions:\n1. Is the 'arguments' parameter to Jsr233ScriptEvaluator#determineScriptEngine actually necessary?  It's not currently used in the implementation, and it's difficult to imagine a use case where a subclass would use arguments to determine which ScriptEngine to use.  Perhaps this is an oversight?\n2. Can you explain the intention / necessity of the 'runAtStartup' setting in Jsr223ScriptEvaluatorFactoryBean?  getObject will be invoked when singletons are initialized anyway -- is it actually important have such an explicit setting to do this in the @PostConstruct method as well?\n3. Can you explain a use case where EvaluationPolicy (formerly EvaluationType) would be anything other than ALWAYS?  A unit test here would be good.  I'm simply not familiar with the \"script modification\" semantics that are mentioned throughout.  It makes sense when imagining someone using a ScriptEvaluator directly, but against the FactoryBean, it doesn't (yet) make sense to me, unless perhaps the FactoryBean is non-singleton scoped.\n4. Curiosity mostly, but what was the impetus for this change?  Why now?\n5. Could you also add and assign to yourself an issue to add reference documentation for this feature?\n\n@jhoeller, could you take a look at the cumulative set of changes for a sanity check, e.g. that this is appropriate for 3.1.1, etc?  (You can click on the \"Diff\" tab above to see the net result of both my and Costin's commits).\n\nIssue: [SPR-8999](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-8999)\n",
