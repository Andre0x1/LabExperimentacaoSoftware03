        "body": "The menu bar on the left and search always points to the latest docs, which is fine for now, but will need to be updated if we add multiple pages of documentation for another version.\r\n\r\nThe ideas is that the latest docs would be available at svelte.dev/docs while other versions would be available at svelte.dev/docs/3 or whatever. Right now this has the full documentation available at svelte.dev/docs and a single placeholder page at svelte.dev/docs/5\r\n\r\nI chose to go with a version under the docs URL as it's the main thing that needs to be versioned. The only other thing that needs to be versioned is the REPL, but it makes sense to do that separately as the docs just need a major version and the REPL needs a specific patch version and the REPL already have versioning built-in. Versioning really doesn't make sense for things like the blog posts.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, docs will be entirely powered by the `master` branch. What's on other branches will not affect the docs site. I doubt we'll be adding many new features to older versions, so it's pretty rare that people will be updating the code and docs on an old branch at the same time. We can delete the docs from non-master branches as well to prevent confusion. On the otherhand, I imagine it will be more common that you want to update the docs for multiple versions at one time. In that case it's easier to have the docs for multiple versions present in `master` so you don't have to send two PRs.",

This file is currently in the language-tools repo and ships with svelte2tsx, but the problem is that TypeScript will load the `svelte/elements` version that comes with the svelte-language-server. Moving this to the Svelte core makes TypeScript always resolve it to the user-installed/workspace version of Svelte. Making it resolve to the user version also fixes the problem with the declaration merging of `declare module \"svelte/elements\"`. This allows the user/library to add custom types with it. For example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// app.d.ts\r\nimport { HTMLButtonAttributes } from 'svelte/elements'\r\n\r\ndeclare module 'svelte/elements' {\r\n    export interface SvelteHTMLElements {\r\n        'custom-button': HTMLButtonAttributes;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    export interface HTMLButtonAttributes {\r\n        'veryexperimentalattribute': string;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file is meant to be loaded by ts or svelte-language-server. It's not meant to be user-facing. So this doesn't need to be in the package.json export and doesn't need documentation on its usage. @dummdidumm What do you think about the file naming and the declare module thing? ",

This feels like regular serverless, but these have no cold starts, smaller runtime and overall a little bit faster. It could have been regular edge function deployed globally, but not sure how that would affect performance for users far away from the supabase instance. Worth experimenting though~~\r\n\r\nEntire is prerendered, and REPL is edge functions. They aren't regional yet, as there's a chance that with new infra, for far away users, the REPL interfacing with supabase will stay mostly the same speed, and for those closer to the database instance should experience much higher boost, so its win win. its all speculation thought, but there's absolutely no risk in going with global edge\r\n\r\n## Everything fs async\r\n\r\nI found all the implementations of `fs.somethingSync` and replaced them with their promise based alternatives, bringing the build time of site down by a lot, and increasing prerender concurrency to 10. Pretty sure our vercel friends can handle this much parallel operations.\r\n\r\n## Reduced build times\r\n\r\nAs stated above, build times are down from average of 2:30 to 1:35, almost an entire minute lesser, all thanks to switching to edge adapter(generating which is must faster) and using the aforementioned everything-async approach\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

        "body": "In a nutshell: Added {#each} while intentionally using map to show that each only iterates over array-like objects.\r\n\r\nI replaced existing code for radio buttons with {#each}, each radio button requires two dynamic values so I thought of creating an object. This video, https://youtu.be/dB_YjuAMH3o?t=224 by Rich Harris himself, addressing the quirk where {#each} only iterates over array-like objects. So I tried it and got the following, beautifully written, compile error:\r\n{#each} only iterates over array-like objects. You can use a spread to convert this iterable into an array.\r\n\r\nThe thought process here is that if someone sees the example using:\r\nfor [...radios] as radio instead of, for radios as radio, they will tinker around to see why that is the case and if they try doing otherwise repl will give the above mentioned error to let them know the reason, helping them understand the quirks of svelte.\r\n\r\nI understand that this might not turn out to be the appropriate way of showing the quirk, so if that's the case, I do request having a seperate example for this.",

        "body": "This provides us with better type declarations and a smaller package. On the `version-4` branch, the `types` directory takes 300kb (or 1.1MB on disk, because it's 264 separate files). In this PR, it takes 23kb (25kb on disk) with two files.\r\n\r\nAll the types are put into a single bundle, and treeshaken (so we don't ship internal types that aren't referenced by public APIs). \r\n\r\nAs well as the size benefits, this provides a much better experience for Svelte users. This is what happens today:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/assets/1162160/c7c0538d-e137-47a0-a7af-2d99ac99c701\r\n\r\nNotice a few things:\r\n\r\n* VSCode auto-imports `svelte/internal.js`. `svelte` is available in the auto-import menu (it's confusing that they're both there), but you have to actively select it\r\n* Cmd-clicking on `onMount` takes you to the .d.ts file, rather than the implementation. (Even though the implementation isn't all that self-explanatory in the case of `onMount`, developers [overwhelmingly prefer this behaviour](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1660629715613368320).)\r\n* Typing `in:fade` doesn't trigger an auto-import for `svelte/transition` \u2014 VSCode simply can't find it. It _can_ find a horrendous list of internal junk like `fix_and_destroy_block` from `svelte/types/runtime/internal/each`\r\n* When you manually import it, it tries to autocomplete to `svelte/transition.js`, most likely because of my editor configuration. This will not resolve correctly\r\n* you can cmd-click on `fade` but, again, it takes you to the type declaration. This time, it _is_ useful to go straight to the implementation, to understand how you'd build your own custom transition\r\n\r\nWith this PR, things look very different:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/assets/1162160/f26bc414-8063-4b64-b125-90e567b7a373\r\n\r\nBecause it uses `declare module`, nothing relies on the app developer having the right TypeScript/editor configuration (`moduleResolution`, file extension preferences etc) to get the right imports, and there are no false positives \u2014 just the public API.",

If it's bundled then we need to make sure we're raising a security vulnerability against Svelte which bundles a vulnerable version of a library and we're not doing that, which means that all security vulnerabilities in dependencies go unflagged.\r\n\r\nThis may result in more being downloaded on average. However, many of our dependencies like `magic-string`, `@jridgewell/sourcemap-codec`, etc. are already used by other projects like Rollup, `svelte-preprocess`, etc. For npm users, this will avoid the download cost if the dependency is already used by the project. For users using package managers like pnpm, this is an even bigger win as those dependencies won't need to be downloaded if they are used by any other project you've already installed.\r\n\r\nWe also avoid generating source maps for these packages when we avoid bundling, which will really shrink the size of the Svelte package. For packages like `periscopic` which distribute unbundled source, this is a big win as they don't need source maps at all. For packages which have sourcemaps of their own, we don't get that savings, but we could probably convert some of the libraries to this lighter-weight way of being distributed especially if they're ones we control.",

        "body": "This is an overhaul of custom elements in Svelte. Instead of compiling to a custom element class, the Svelte component class is mostly preserved as-is. Instead a wrapper is introduced which wraps a Svelte component constructor and returns a HTML element constructor. This has a couple of advantages:\r\n\r\n- component can be used both as a custom element as well as a regular component. This allows creating one wrapper custom element and using regular Svelte components inside. Fixes #3594, fixes #3128, fixes #4274, fixes #5486, fixes #3422, fixes #2969, helps with https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4502\r\n- all components are compiled with injected styles (inlined through Javascript), fixes #4274\r\n- the wrapper instantiates the component in `connectedCallback` and disconnects it in `disconnectedCallback` (but only after one tick, because this could be a element move). Mount/destroy works as expected inside, fixes #5989, fixes #8191\r\n- the wrapper forwards `addEventListener` calls to `component.$on`, which allows to listen to custom events, fixes #3119, closes #4142 \r\n- some things are hard to auto-configure, like attribute hyphen preferences or whether or not setting a property should reflect back to the attribute. This is why `<svelte:options customElement={..}>` can also take an object to modify such aspects. This option allows to specify whether setting a prop should be reflected back to the attribute (default `false`), what to use when converting the property to the attribute value and vice versa (through `type`, default `String`, or when `export let prop = false` then `Boolean`), and what the corresponding attribute for the property is (`attribute`, default lowercased prop name). These options are heavily inspired by lit: https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties. Closes #7638, fixes #5705\r\n- adds a `shadowdom` option to control whether or not encapsulate the custom element. Closes #4330, closes #1748 \r\n\r\n# Breaking changes:\r\nWrapped Svelte component now stays as a regular Svelte component (invokeing it like before with `new Component({ target: ..})` won't create a custom element). Its custom element constructor is now a static property named `element` on the class (`Component.element`) and should be regularly invoked through setting it in the html.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- const component = new Component({ target: someDiv, props: { foo: 'bar' } });\r\n+ const component = document.createElement('custom-element-tag');\r\n+ component.foo = 'bar';\r\n+ someDiv.appendChild(component);\r\n// or, if you have no attributes or only have simple string attributes:\r\n+ someDiv.innerHTML = '<custom-element-tag foo=\"bar\"></custom-element-tag>';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe timing of mount/destroy/update is different. Mount/destroy/updating a prop all happen after a tick, so `shadowRoot.innerHTML` won't immediately reflect the change (Lit does this too). If you rely on it, you need to await a promise for example:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nconst component = someDiv.innerHTML = '<custom-element-tag foo=\"bar\"></custom-element-tag>';\r\n+ await Promise.resolve();\r\nsomeDiv.querySelector('custom-element-tag').shadowRoot.querySelector('div');\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

One big reason why there is `Not implemented undefined` is because we somehow have one variable declaration node wrapped in an array, so it tries to read the AST type of the array which doesn't exist. What I have done instead is that instead of replacing a `Node` with a `Node[]`, I put the props and inserts to the right of the current node, as siblings in an array and get rid of the current node if necessary, like what the `this.replace` did but flattened on the same array. If the variable declaration is not a node in an array (ie, a standalone statement), a 'dummy' variable is created for the sole purpose of calling inserts.\r\n\r\nHopefully this does not break things too much.

        "body": "Closes #5876. As discussed there, `css-tree` is not updated for the latest CSS syntax including the ability to use [single value functions (calc, etc.)](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5643732019838976) in media queries. `css-tree` also does not yet support [media query range syntax](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/media-query-range-syntax/) that is part of the media query level 4 specification. \r\n\r\nThis PR broadly helps the entire Svelte ecosystem including SvelteKit.\r\n\r\nGiven the acceptance of the container query PR (#8275) to extend `css-tree` to support container queries I was able to refactor this extension support repurposing the range syntax support to apply to both container & media queries. At the same time the single value function support implemented for container queries also applies to media queries. \r\n\r\nChanges\r\nsrc/compiler/parse/read/css-tree-cq/css_tree_parse.ts: cleanup new AST node import / assignment.\r\n\r\nsrc/compiler/parse/read/css-tree-cq/node/index.ts: added for convenience to export all nodes cleanly.\r\n\r\nsrc/compiler/parse/read/css-tree-cq/node/lookahead_is_range.ts: separated utility function out to be used by CQ / MQ.\r\n\r\nsrc/compiler/parse/read/css-tree-cq/node/media_query.ts: provides new media query node implementation.\r\n\r\nsrc/compiler/parse/read/css-tree-cq/node/query_feature.ts: renamed from container_feature.ts\r\n\r\nsrc/compiler/parse/read/css-tree-cq/node/query_range_feature.ts: renamed from container_range_feature.ts\r\n\r\ntest/css/samples/media-query: Updated parsing test case with range syntax and single value function use cases.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nNo downsides that I'm aware of regarding these changes. Simply that Svelte can now ship with updated media query syntax support. I have thoroughly tested the code and updated the media query parsing test accordingly. Because the fork capability of css-tree is used to extend it the css-tree version can keep being bumped if new versions come out without updated MQ support. However, when the unified queries support is added to `css-tree` the local extensions can be removed and an easy swap back to the official css-tree parse capability is trivial.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nThe media query parsing test has been updated for range syntax and single value function use cases.\r\n\r\ncss-tree Extension\r\nThe bulk of this PR is a refactor of the container query implementation to share the range syntax and single value function support added in the CQ PR between both media and container queries via local extension of css-tree using the fork capability of css-tree to just modify how the `MediaQuery` node is parsed. The benefit of taking this approach is that the temporary modifications necessary to extend css-tree are committed to the Svelte repo and a separate hard fork of css-tree isn't necessary. The css-tree version can continue to be bumped as necessary and when css-tree supports modern query syntax the local extension can be removed.\r\n\r\nIt is unknown when css-tree will be updated to support modern query support. However, when css-tree does offer support a one line change and removal of the extensions provided in this PR is trivial.\r\n\r\n",

While enums may seem like a convenient way to define a set of related constants, they have a number of drawbacks that make them less than ideal for usage in production code.\r\n\r\nFor one, TypeScript enums are not as flexible as regular objects. Once an enum is defined, it cannot be modified at runtime, and its properties cannot be accessed or modified using standard object methods. This can make it difficult to work with enums in certain situations, especially when dealing with complex or dynamic data.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, TypeScript enums can be more cumbersome to use than simple object literals. Enum values are accessed using dot notation, which can be verbose and repetitive, especially when working with deeply nested structures. In contrast, object literals can be accessed using bracket notation, which is more concise and flexible.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, this PR proposes replacing the existing enums with frozen objects, which are simple JavaScript objects that have been made immutable using Object.freeze(). By using frozen objects, we can achieve the same level of type safety as enums, while also gaining the flexibility and ease-of-use of standard objects.\r\n\r\nIn addition, frozen objects allow us to define more complex data structures than enums, such as objects with nested properties or arrays of objects. This can make our code more modular and easier to reason about, especially in large codebases.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the transition from enums to frozen objects, this PR includes updated documentation and tests, as well as refactored code to use frozen objects instead of enums.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n\r\n    Replaced all instances of BlockAppliesToNode and NodeExist enums with frozen objects in the index.ts file.\r\n    Updated documentation and tests to reflect the use of frozen objects.\r\n    Refactored code to use frozen objects instead of enums.\r\n\r\n### Impact:\r\n\r\nThis change should have no impact on the behavior of the codebase, as frozen objects behave identically to enums in most situations. However, this change should make the codebase more maintainable and flexible in the long term, and should make it easier to work with complex or dynamic data structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Closes #6969. As discussed there, container query support is quite useful to add to Svelte as it is now broadly available with Firefox releasing support imminently w/ FF v110 this upcoming week (~Feb 14th). Chrome has had support since ~Aug '22. The central issue is that `css-tree` which is a dependency for CSS AST parsing is significantly lagging behind on adding more recent features  such as container query support. Ample time has been given to the maintainer to update `css-tree` and I do have every confidence that in time `css-tree` will receive a new major version with all sorts of modern CSS syntax supported including container queries.  This PR provides an interim solution for what Svelte needs to support container queries now.\r\n\r\n_This PR broadly helps the entire Svelte ecosystem including SvelteKit._\r\n\r\n_Changes_\r\n------------------------------\r\n`src/compiler/parse/read/style.ts`: Switch to locally forked `css-tree` w/ CQ support.\r\n\r\n`src/compiler/parse/read/css-tree-cq/css_tree_parse.ts`: `fork` `css-tree` w/ local extension. \r\n\r\n`src/compiler/parse/read/css-tree-cq/node`: `css-tree` new CQ nodes.\r\n\r\n`src/compiler/compile/css/Stylesheet.ts`: Trivial one line change to enable CQ support in Svelte.\r\n\r\n`test/css/samples/container-query`: Parsing test case.\r\n\r\n_Impact_\r\n------------------------------\r\nNo downsides that I'm aware of regarding these changes. Simply that Svelte can now ship `3.56.0` w/ CQ support. I have thoroughly tested the code and added an additional test to the `svelte` repo. Because I'm using the `fork` capability of `css-tree` to extend it the `css-tree` version can keep being bumped if new versions come out without CQ support. However, when CQ support is added my local extensions can be removed and an easy swap back to the official `css-tree` parse capability is trivial. \r\n\r\n_Testing_\r\n------------------------------\r\nA new test was added in the `css` section `container-query` that runs through several common usage permutations. Just like the `media-query` test it contains positive tests that ensure parsing.\r\n\r\n_`css-tree` Extension_\r\n------------------------------\r\nThe bulk of this PR is local extension of `css-tree` using the `fork` capability of `css-tree` to add new parsing nodes that implement the parsing of `@container`.  The benefit of taking this approach is that the temporary modifications necessary to extend `css-tree` are committed to the Svelte repo and a separate hard fork of `css-tree` isn't necessary. The `css-tree` version can continue to be bumped as necessary and when `css-tree` supports container queries the local extension can be removed. \r\n\r\nIt is unknown when `css-tree` will be updated to support container queries and other more recent style options like media range query syntax. However, when `css-tree` does offer support a one line change and removal of the extensions provided in this PR is trivial.\r\n\r\nI would be glad to discuss the `css-tree` specific parsing code added. I certainly recognize that an internal knowledge of `css-tree` is probably not widely held by most of the Svelte maintainers. My extension follows current patterns used in `css-tree` itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of duplicating all conversation from #6969 Please refer to that issue for pertinent prior discussion. As indicated in the last few comments there (https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6969#issuecomment-1407499672) I have released a temporary version of Svelte 3.55.1 on NPM that can be used to test these changes now in live environments. Two other community members responded that these changes work as intended including a SvelteKit trial. \r\n\r\nTagging: @tanhauhau (you created the `css-tree` issue in response to the initial triage of #6969) and @dummdidumm. Please include any other relevant maintainers for review.",

        "body": "Ref: #820 \r\n\r\nThis adds the [`no-static-element-interactions`](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/main/docs/rules/no-static-element-interactions.md) rule from [`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) as a compiler rule. It is tripped if an element with no semantic meaning on the accessibility layer (e.g. `div`, `a` without `href`, `header` when it is not a direct descendant of `body`) does not have a `role` and has an interactive handler (e.g. `on:click`, `on:mousedown`).\r\n\r\nThis implementation follows the options from the recommended config by the ESLint plugin. That means:\r\n- Dynamic role values are allowed\r\n- We only check for these handlers:\r\n  - `on:click`\r\n  - `on:mousedown`\r\n  - `on:mouseup`\r\n  - `on:keypress`\r\n  - `on:keydown`\r\n  - `on:keyup`\r\n\r\nIn the ESLint plugin's default state, it disallows dynamic role values and checks for every `focus`, `keyboard`, and `mouse` handler. If we want to do this, we can remove the dynamic role check and copy the relevant handlers from [`index.d.ts`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/elements/index.d.ts#L65).\r\n\r\nNote that this PR also removes `generic` from `non_interactive_roles` in `src/compiler/compile/utils/a11y.ts`. It is also excluded from the [associated array in `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/main/src/util/isNonInteractiveElement.js#L23), and removing it made the new rule behave correctly, so I believe its inclusion was a bug. This did not affect any of the tests for the existing a11y rules, but I suspect it may still be a breaking change in some rare cases.\r\n\r\n### New breaking change here\r\n\r\n- **Who does this affect**: Users who are not compliant with `no-static-element-interactions` from `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, configured with the options from the plugin's recommended config\r\n- **How to migrate**: Add an appropriate ARIA role to the static element with an interactive handler\r\n- **Why make this breaking change**: Improves accessibility\r\n- **Severity (number of people affected x effort)**: Likely affects a moderate number of people, but low effort to fix\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- \u2611\ufe0f It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

        "body": "# Breaking change / how to migrate\r\n\r\nThe `onMount` type definition was updated to make returning a function (or `any`, which could also be a function) asynchronously is a type error because in 90% of cases it hints at a mistake: You likely want the returned function to be called on destroy, but that does not happen for asynchronously returned functions.\r\n\r\nTo migrate, adjust the code so you don't return a function asynchronously. Note that you also get the error if you return `any` because `any` includes function types. \r\n\r\nIf this change revealed an actual bug in your code:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nonMount(\r\n- async () => {\r\n-   const something = await foo();\r\n+ () => {\r\n+  foo().then(something =>  ..\r\n   // ..\r\n   return () => someCleanup();\r\n}\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this change results in a false positive, just make it not return a function:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- onMount(() => someFunctionThatReturnsAFunctionButYouDontCare())\r\n+ onMount(() => { someFunctionThatReturnsAFunctionButYouDontCare(); })\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR description\r\n\r\nFrom the docs for onMount (https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-onmount) a cleanup function can be returned from onMount which will then be used on dismount for cleanup. These only work for synchronous functions, not async.\r\n\r\nWe just discovered a few mistakes in our codebase in which the following pattern was used:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nonMount(async () => {\r\n   // do mount\r\n\r\n   return () => {\r\n      // cleanup\r\n   }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am proposing a types change to the onMount function to only accept the following function signatures:\r\n\r\n- `() => void` - async no cleanup \r\n- `() => Promise<void>` - async no cleanup\r\n- `() => (() => void)` - synchronous cleanup\r\n\r\nThis will catch mistakes where the cleanup would not be run.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

It looks like the `iframe` not always fire an initial resize event, probably related to the `iframe` loading asynchronously. This can be fixed by triggering a resize event inside the `onload` event of the `iframe`.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the long term plan to implement a solution using `ResizeObserver` alongside quirky and slow `iframe` solution (see #5963 and https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/5524#issuecomment-727280861). But the `iframe` solution will stay around for a long time, and this little PR fixes one of the common issues it has.\r\n\r\nI've tested this solution manually in a separate project on Chrome and Firefox. It resolves the cases reported in #4233 and does not cause duplicate updates on the end-users side. I'm trying to write an integration test (see PR), but I can't get that to work as expected yet (both properties `width` and `height` are rendered with value `0`). Any idea what I'm overlooking there?",

Elements with the role `tabpanel` are a special exception to the rule of noninteractive elements having a positive tab index. It is recommended that tab panels have a positive tabindex when their first element is not focusable. \r\n\r\n- [Link to relevant section in Aria docs](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#keyboard-interaction-21)\r\n- [This Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/tabs/tabs-automatic) in the Aria Authoring guides also recommends allowing a positive tabindex for tab panels. \r\n\r\nAdding this will get rid of annoying error for people who are trying to implement accessible tab panels in their code.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- Updated the unit test for this rule to check for tabpanel role also. Tested with the script and it passed.\r\n",

Ex : `svelte:display|lazy={visible}`\r\n - I didn't write any unit test, but i could do it later.\r\n - No docs either, but I'm afraid I'm not the best to do that (not an english speaker).\r\n \r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [X] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

I added the `?.` operator so it would call the `tick` function just if it is defined.\r\n\r\nAfter that was solved, another issue emerged, but it was related to the `detach` function on `dom.ts` file. It was calling \r\n`removeChild` from a `parentNode`, but `parentNode` was `null` (`node.parentNode?.removeChild(node);`).

This allows you to work around requiring `unsafe-inline` CSP discussed in #6662 by adding a hash to your CSP:\r\n```\r\n'sha256-9OlNO0DNEeaVzHL4RZwCLsBHA8WBQ8toBp/4F5XV2nc='\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the hash of the empty string, `'sha256-47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU='`, works fine in most browsers, but Safari for some reason thinks the empty string should have a different hash.\r\n\r\nUsers currently using the empty string hash (like me) will have their apps break from this, but it currently only half works anyway so I don't think that's a big deal.\r\n\r\nAs @Rich-Harris has said this isn't very elegant, and the eventual solution is to use the Web Animations API instead, but I'd still like for this to work on iOS in the mean time :)",

I noticed that re-wrapping the promise in a `Promise.resolve()`  fixed it. I have shown this in my sample repo: https://github.com/Vilsol/svelte-promise-bug/blob/main/src/routes/%2Bpage.svelte#L12-L20 And as you can see the test passes only the `a` case: https://github.com/Vilsol/svelte-promise-bug/runs/7876500320?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nI have also added a test with this PR that simulates having the underlying type of a function, yet functioning as a Promise.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

        "body": "## The bug\r\nI worked on a svelte-kit application with some very large SVG's, and they made it almost impossible to work on the application (because of slow development time).\r\n\r\nI have created a repo with one of the SVG's if you want to see it yourself: https://github.com/MathiasWP/svelte-attribute-bottleneck\r\n\r\nNote that i created the repo with the old svelte-template because i wanted to ensure this wasn't a Vite bug.\r\n\r\n## The solution\r\nI found out that the method `read_attribute_value`  + `read_sequence` in `src/compiler/parse/state/tag.ts` was the big bottleneck. It has a while loop that loops `n = template.length` amount of times (in the test cases i have added this was 1.7 million times). \r\n\r\nOn every loop a RegEx check was ran with the parser. This RegEx call was suboptimal, so i changed the code from using `parser.match_regex` to using `parser.match` with characters that mirror the RegEx call. \r\n\r\nChanging from using RegEx to a strict string equality check massively improved the performance:\r\n\r\nWith regex: _~30s_\r\nWith new setup:  _~260ms_\r\n\r\nThis is a 99% shave-off in execution time \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

After clearing them, it removed them from its internal map by running `managed_styles.clear()`. This cleanup was not optimal - it left the style elements empty in the dom.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is to remove style-elements created by `style_manager`, instead of making them empty and letting them stay in the DOM without any references. I also refactored some of the methods from the `runtime/internal/dom.ts` file that were only used by the `style_manager` or in the `dom.ts file` itself.\r\n\r\nIf you want to reverse-engineer this bug yourself, then start with the `append_empty_stylesheet` method in the `dom.ts` file. As long as `append_empty_stylesheet` is used, there will be bugs related to empty stylesheets. It does the following:\r\n1. Creates an empty style-element\r\n2. Appends it to the dom\r\n3. Returns only the sheet of the new style-element, leaving the style-tag totally unreferenced by any code",

        "body": "It is not possible to use typescript when using `target: document`\r\nduring component initialization, because target can only be of type\r\nElement or ShadowRoot. This means that it is not possible to hydrate\r\nthe entire document when managing the <html> element as a Svelte\r\ncomponent.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this by allowing documents to be targets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that this just fixes the type constraint of the target option in IComponentOptions. Svelte already works well when hydrating the document root with `target: document` in regular javascript, so this just relaxes the type constraint.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me how to add a test for this -- this can only work when hydrating and there's no skip_if_not_hydrate in test/runtime.  This fix was hand-tested with the following setup, but I'd appreciate help in turning this into an actual test.\r\n\r\nGiven the following App.svelte:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script lang=\"ts\">\r\nexport let name: string;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head></head>\r\n<body>Hello, {name}</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the following main.ts:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport App from './App.svelte';\r\n\r\nconst app = new App({\r\n\ttarget: document,\r\n\thydrate: true,\r\n\tprops: {\r\n\t\tname: 'world'\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default app;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding the bundle results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/main.ts \u2192 build/static/bundle.js...\r\n(!) Plugin typescript: @rollup/plugin-typescript TS2322: Type 'Document' is not assignable to type 'Element | ShadowRoot'.\r\n  Type 'Document' is missing the following properties from type 'ShadowRoot': delegatesFocus, host, mode, slotAssignment, innerHTML\r\nsrc/main.ts: (5:2)\r\n\r\n7  target: document,\r\n   ~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  node_modules/svelte/types/runtime/internal/dev.d.ts:28:5\r\n    28     target: Element | ShadowRoot;\r\n           ~~~~~~\r\n    The expected type comes from property 'target' which is declared here on type 'IComponentOptions<Record<string, any>>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this commit, the error goes away.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround I'm using is adding a `// @ts-nocheck` at the top of main.ts. This is of course horribly sad, since we just throw type checking out the window.",

We have optimsiation to use `innerHTML` to create static element nodes, however, this is de-optimised, when the `hydratable` flag is on.\r\n  This PR allows the element nodes to be claimed using `innerHTML`. It will create a `data-svelte` hash on the element that can be optimised this way, and if the `data-svelte` hash does not match, it will fallback to use `innerHTML` to \"fix\" the elements.\r\n2. when `{@html xxx}` is the only child of an element, we \"optimised\" by setting `parent.innerHTML = xxx` on mount, for both CSR and hydration. However, for hydration, this will destroy and recreate existing elements from the SSR.\r\n  When we have `{@html xxx}` as the only child of an element, we add `data-svelte` hash and only do `.innerHTML` if the hash does not match.\r\n3. while adding tests for above, found there's some differences in the HTML from CSR and SSR, namely, when there's space between sibling elements, `\\s\\t\\r\\n`, CSR collapse them into 1 space element `' '`, however SSR maintains the original spaces. this PR fix the consistency by collapsing spaces in SSR into 1 space `' '`. since however many space between the sibling elements, as long as they are not within `<pre>` or `<textarea>`, browser will treat them as only 1 space element.

After clearing them, it removed them from its internal map by running `managed_styles.clear()`. This cleanup was not optimal - it left the style elements empty in the dom.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is to remove style-elements created by `style_manager`, instead of making them empty and letting them stay in the DOM without any references. I also refactored some of the methods from the `runtime/internal/dom.ts` file that were only used by the `style_manager` or in the `dom.ts file` itself.\r\n\r\nIf you want to reverse-engineer this bug yourself, then start with the `append_empty_stylesheet` method in the `dom.ts` file. As long as `append_empty_stylesheet` is used, there will be bugs related to empty stylesheets. It does the following:\r\n1. Creates an empty style-element\r\n2. Appends it to the dom\r\n3. Returns only the sheet of the new style-element, leaving the style-tag totally unreferenced by any code",

Without `strict` mode, required arguments are still optional (this is a TypeScript limitation).\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

Since there are no such types in the reop yet, I don't know how the Svelte-team want to handle this.\r\n\r\nRegarding tests:\r\nThere are no `types tests` in the repo yet, so I propose to create a `types` folder in the `test` directory and paste the example above to a file inside that directory. The test command then would need to be extended with a `tsc --noEmit` command on this folder.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

There is a single generated stylesheet where transition keyframe rules are added / removed at runtime for transitions. Currently if more than one app / runtime transitions at the same time the first runtime to finish all of its transitions clears out the style sheet which is also holding transition rules for all other Svelte runtimes.\r\n\r\nThis causes all sorts of visual glitching issues with transitions between separately compiled Svelte apps running on the same browser page. \r\n\r\nThe fix is low impact and that is to assign a unique ID key and create temporary / transition style sheets for each Svelte runtime. This is accomplished with `Date.now`, but I am certainly open to suggestions on a better unique ID generation mechanism. \r\n\r\nNo new tests are required and all tests pass. \r\n\r\nBelow is a gif that shows the transition interruption. The left and right apps are separately compiled Svelte apps. On this platform (FoundryVTT) pressing `esc` closes all apps, so both close at the same time. The left app has a one second scale transition. The right app has a two second scale transition. When the left app finishes at one second it clears out all transition styles and interrupts the right apps transition. The right app will display fully and then disappear after the end of the two second transition when it is removed from the DOM.\r\n![svelte-7026-no-fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311473/148312094-28cc0780-9532-4f94-8e7a-81b3895b1745.gif)\r\n\r\nApologies if I am pinging the wrong folks. I waited until after the holiday weeks to move this forward. I am including the last two committers to `style_manager.ts`:\r\n- @tanhauhau \r\n- @ivanhofer \r\n\r\nAlso \r\n@benmccann from our discussion from `#contributing` on Discord.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue is a big quality problem for usage of Svelte in platform use cases. I have made a really nice Svelte integration for the Foundry VTT platform and am imminently releasing a library / tool suite for all 3rd party Foundry developers. I certainly appreciate the help in getting this PR merged and am more than willing to modify it according to any advice from the maintainers. ",

This version includes refactored tests and merge squashes the previous commits.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows Svelte's built-in transitions to work under a strict content security policy (CSP) without the `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` CSP directive. It checks for presence of an external CSS stylesheet with the title 'svelte-stylesheet' which contains no CSS rules (i.e. a blank stylesheet). This stylesheet is used at the beginning of the 1st transition rather creating a blank stylesheet and appending it to the DOM (which is in effect inline CSS, which a strict CSP won't allow). If the 'svelte-stylesheet' is not present, everything works the same as before (this also means that transitions will not work under a strict CSP without `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`).\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

So maybe this fix is okay...)\r\n(If my understanding is wrong, please correct me.)\r\n\r\n``` JavaScript\r\nconst condition = attr.node.dependencies.size > 0\r\n  ? block.renderer.dirty(attr.node.get_dependencies())\r\n  : null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think the original code is okay regarding this part.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nI think the root cause is different behavior between normal variables and spread syntax.\r\nBut I don't know how to fix it.\r\n\r\nBut I think, this behavior becomes an issue only during user input.\r\nAnd I think in most cases, attributes are not changed during user input.\r\n\r\nTherefore I thought 2 ways to fix this issue.\r\n\r\n### **1. Stop calling unnecessary `set_attributes`.**\r\n\r\nThe runtime calls `set_attributes` even if `min` is not changed but it's not necessary.\r\nSo I thought if we can handle it at compile process, this is good.\r\nBut associative array (or JSON) can have nested objects.\r\nTherefore compile process will be significantly complicated or impossible to handle.\r\nAnd I think this is too much at least for this issue.\r\nSo I didn't choose this way.\r\n\r\n### **2. Stop setting value if it's not changed (I choose this way in the PR)**\r\n\r\nThis is a simple way.\r\nBased on the assumption that the attributes will not change during user input,\r\n`set_attributes` will not apply new value if it's not changed.\r\nActually already `attr` function did this way.\r\nSo It'll just be the same process.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

That is also why this is a draft PR; once #6750 is either merged or rejected I'll convert this PR from a draft to a real PR (and also rebase it so there are no merge conflicts).\r\n\r\nBasing this PR on top of #6750 brings the unfortunate effect that it can be hard to see this PR's changes in isolation, so I've created https://github.com/rmunn/svelte/pull/1 to see this PR's changes compared to the changes in #6750.

        "body": "Currently, Svelte's built-in transitions do not work when using a strict Content Security Policy (CSP)\r\nunless the `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` directive is present, which is a security vulnerability in production. This happens because Svelte appends an empty CSS stylesheet to the DOM at the start of the 1st transition. This is in effect inline css, which a strict CSP won't allow without `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`.\r\n\r\nA simple solution is to add a blank external stylesheet (e.g. in the same location as 'global.css') to be used for the starting transition. This PR checks for presence of an external CSS stylesheet with the title 'svelte-stylesheet' and which contains no CSS rules (i.e. a blank stylesheet). If the 'svelte-stylesheet' is not present, everything works the same as before (this also means that transitions will not work under a strict CSP without `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`).\r\n\r\nTo implement, add the following to the Svelte project's 'index.html' file:  `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" title=\"svelte-stylesheet\" href=\"svelte-stylesheet.css\">`. Then add the blank css file specified in the href attribute (the name of the file is not important, as long as the origin is permitted in the CSP, e.g. in the same folder/location as 'global.css').\r\n\r\nFixes [#6662](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6662).\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

To run these tests run the following command in terminal `npm run test -- -g svelte-styles-csp`. By default these will run headless. To see the transitions in Chromium, set the `headless_browser` constant to true in 'tests/svelte-styles-csp/index.ts'.\r\n\r\n(note I attempted to write a unit test for the function `get_svelte_style_sheet_index()` using Mocha and JSDom.

(Changing the second attr.node.get_dependencies() method to New Array (attr.node.dependencies) also worked for my issue, but I wanted to change as little as possible. Didn't check if it didn't break the previous bug again.

The setup callback in `readable` and `writable` stores can now be either in `(set) => { }` form or in `(set, update) => { }` form. And the value-deriving callback in `derived` can now take an optional third parameter `update` in addition to the optional second parameter `set`.\r\n\r\nMost of the use cases that would benefit from this are already possible, but would be made easier with this PR. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst store = writable(0);\r\nconst history = derived(store, (newValue, set, update) => {\r\n  update(values => [...values, newValue]);\r\n}, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst store = writable(0);\r\nconst history = (() => {\r\n  let values = [];\r\n  return derived(store, (newValue, set) => {\r\n    values = [...values, newValue];\r\n    set(values);\r\n  }, values);\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #4880.\r\nFixes #6737.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes for custom stores\r\n\r\nThis is a non-breaking change for anyone *using* Svelte stores, as you can continue to write `(set) => { ... }` as well as `(set, update) => { ... }` in your stores' `start` callbacks. However, this is a **breaking change** for any code that creates a custom store. Your custom stores will now need to pass an `update` parameter to the `start` callback, as well as a `set` parameter.

This lack of consideration caused #6699 error because such a pattern was handled as Identifier.\r\n\r\nI fixed it (and add the test about it).\r\n",

Having a directory that can be sorted by stars means anyone can add theirs and if it's not popular it will fall to the bottom and if it goes unmaintained we can detect that there's been no commits for some very extended period time and surface that or remove the entry",

        "body": "With this fix, doing\r\n```\r\nconst stores= [writable(0), writable(1)]\r\nderived(stores, ([a,b,c]) => {});\r\n```\r\nworks without type errors. The propblem with the previous type signature was that it's too strict for TypeScript's suboptimal inference of the value `stores` in that example, which is `Array<Readable<any>>`, which does not convey the info \"at least one element\", which the old Stores signature required.\r\nRuntime-wise, it's no problem passing an empty array to derived.\r\n\r\nThe new signature is only appended to, not replaced, because the old signature is able to correctly infer the values of each array entry: For `derived([writable(0), writable('foo')], ([a, b]) => {});` the parameters `a` and `b` are correctly inferred as `number` and `string`. If the type would be changed to `type Stores = Readable<any> | Array<Readable<any>>` that would be no longer the case.\r\n\r\nFixes #6178\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

This check existed, but failed to account for relative paths which were returned as absolute paths when checking `img.src`.\r\n- Existing nodes under `<head>` that are not claimed but also not detached should be ignored by `init_hydrate`. These nodes have `node.claim_order === undefined`\r\n- The function `claim_html_tag` should also set `claim_order`.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n- Add a fast path to `init_hydrate` for when most of the nodes are on the longest increasing subsequence.\r\n- Improve claims for text nodes: There are many cases where we try to only claim a prefix of the text node. In these cases, we can use `splitText` to actually only claim the prefix. (Merging text siblings might help further https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/3766)\r\n\r\nEdit2:\r\n- Seems to partially address https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6463\r\n\r\n### Potential issues:\r\n- ~~Is it possible that `location` is overwritten at a local scope by the compiler? This would cause URL normalization to break.~~\r\n",

        "body": "(Hopefully) Closes #4308.\r\n\r\nI am new to working with Svelte so I apologize for any errors beforehand.\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n\r\nI tried to improve https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6204 based on the thread #4308. I personally had problems with elements with CSS animations flickering due to hydration detaching and reattaching nodes (implicitly by re-inserting them) as described in the thread. The page that I was having problems with was almost entirely static, so seeing all the static nodes refresh went against my intuition as to how hydrate would work. So I looked into how this situation could be improved.\r\n\r\n### Old algorithm\r\n\r\n_Edit:_ The algorithm has been improved significantly. See https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6395#issuecomment-858543236 for the new algorithm\r\n\r\nDuring hydration, this new implementation tries to pick a sequence of nodes that we are able to not detach: the first common subsequence of the original Nodes and the `claim_*` requests.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the original nodes are:\r\n `B C D E F D G`\r\n\r\nand the `claim_element` function calls are as follows:\r\n`A B C D D E F G H`\r\n\r\nthe first common subsequence would look like\r\n`B C D D G`\r\n\r\nYou can find this subsequence by iterating through the `claim_element`s and keeping a pointer on the original nodes that you are only able to move forward. For every `claim_element`, if you are able to move the pointer to a matching node on the right, do it. Otherwise, do not move the pointer.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm chooses to preserve the nodes within this subsequence (i.e. not detach them). The rest of the nodes that are requested by `claim_*` are handled as before: they are either found among existing nodes to be detached or created anew.\r\n\r\nNormally, after the claims are done, `append` and `insert` are called with every single child, since the caller assumes that all the children are detached. Since this is not the case anymore (the shared subsequence was not detached), we need to transparently make sure that `append` does what is expected, which in this case might be to insert a node in the middle of existing non-detached children. During `append`, the algorithm tracks the _last appended node_, i.e., what the caller thinks is actually the last child of the `target`. Thus, we can deduce where the caller actually wants to append the node. The `insert` function works similarly.\r\n\r\n### Possible optimizations\r\n\r\nNote that the first common subsequence is not the longest common subsequence:\r\n`B C D E F G`\r\n\r\nWe would prefer to not detach as many nodes as possible, so the _longest_ common subsequence would theoretically be preferable. However, since the `claim_*` functions (if I understand them correctly) are expected to return Nodes directly (and greedily), I am not sure a change can be implemented without changing the compiler side.\r\n\r\nEven though finding the optimal (longest) subsequence to not detach is problematic, it should be possible to further improve the greedy approach based on heuristics. In the example above, the second `D` node that is claimed results in the two nodes `E` and `F` getting detached. If the `D` node is just _Text_ and `E/F` are large _Elements_, that would be quite a sad occurrence. This could be optimized in the future handling Text Nodes differently. I did not implement such an optimization since I was not sure my assumptions are correct and would love to receive feedback.\r\n\r\nOne might also look into what virtual DOM front-end frameworks are doing to find minimal differences https://github.com/localvoid/ivi/blob/2c81ead934b9128e092cc2a5ef2d3cabc73cb5dd/packages/ivi/src/vdom/implementation.ts#L1367 . But I am not sure how applicable those will be to our situation.\r\n\r\nThere may be many more possible optimizations! I am relatively inexperienced with front-end development so I might be missing many optimization opportunities.\r\n\r\n### Possible issues\r\n\r\nWithin the code, I added an additional property `actual_end_child` to `Node` objects during `append` and `insert` calls to make tracking last appended nodes easier. If this is a problem, we can switch to using a `Map<Node, Node>`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThe code passed all the tests but I did not add any new tests since I wasn't sure how to test for whether nodes are being detached. Maybe a _total number of nodes detached_ counter could be used to ensure that the algorithm is working and further optimizations do not cause regressions. Any feedback on this is appreciated.\r\n",

        "body": "As lots of issues (e.g. #1067, #6204) have discussed, there are more DOM changes than one might expect during hydration, which reduces performance.\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt at significantly reducing the number of DOM changes with a quite minor change to the code. In my tests, it speeds up hydration by around 25%.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the issue with the DOM manipulation during hydration is not so much that nodes are removed and recreated (because they generally are recycled), as that during the mount phase we will append them to their parent in order, which actually causes them to reorder:\r\n\r\nIf you have the child nodes A and B present in the SSR HTML and hydration starts by appending A, A will move to the end and the order becomes B followed by A. It will be reversed again when B is appended, thereby giving the desired order. These reorderings are quite slow.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes that by:\r\n\r\n * Storing a property on claimed nodes, signalling that they will be hydrated\r\n * Keeping track of an \"insert pointer\" on the parent node. In the example above, it would start at 0. As A is appended, it would notice that the node A is already at position 0 and therefore do nothing, except increase the pointer. Then B is appended, but B is already the node at position 1 so again there is nothing to be done. As it has reached the end of the node list, the pointer is removed from the node again.\r\n\r\nIn actually hydration, the picture is muddied by various less straightforward cases, but in 7 cases out of 8 in my tests, the algorithm above was able to find find the correct next node and therefore skip a DOM operation.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

I suspect that somebody using Svelte as their first framework would be confused too.\r\n\r\n**In brief, \u2028\u2028I think the demo is not good at illustrating the bug (and consequently, the need to use Keys).**\r\n\r\nI've left more info in the issue description.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nMy solutions in this PR:\r\n1. Make something closer to a real-world use case, so Expected Behaviour will be more intuitive. For example, deriving a variable from a prop by using a lookup, rather than directly reassigning it.\r\n2. Use a clear sequence of objects (e.g. alphabetized words)\r\n3. Make an intuitive match between the prop and the derived variable, so the bug looks like clearly \u201cundesired behaviour\u201d (e.g. a word and the corresponding emoji)\r\n4. Add the minimum amount of text to the Tutorial text to explain the bug and why Keys fix it.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n* Tutorial text may be too wordy\r\n* It's still unclear why keys fix things\r\n* Now you want to eat a doughnut\r\n\r\n## Gifs\r\n\r\n![Svelte PR - Keyed Each Blocks demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27756206/119285526-15ae6900-bbf7-11eb-9ece-fd6e60b41c31.gif)\r\n",

If it is please let me know and I can change the PR to use Squoosh. \r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the GitHub API tokens in the file, as the API route to fetch the contributors list doesn't require authentication.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n-  [x] Run the tests with `npm test` and lint the project with `npm run lint`\r\n",

It would cause a scope issue. \r\n\r\nFor example, in this [repo](https://svelte.dev/repl/8aa621af75574acd8d4c041517dee038?version=3.37.0)\r\nThe error variable is overridden by the resolved result.\r\nAs for the error in #6173, It is because the error variable has also been overridden.

It fails the WCAG AA Standard with a contrast ratio of 1.4.\r\n\r\nSince it's kind of hard to meet the contrast ratio standard by keeping a vibrant yellow color (similar to the current one) and a light background, I consider it better to switch the yellow color for an orange/tan color (similar to the Svelte color) and a lighter background color, so it passes WCAG AA.\r\n",

Thanks to @jonatansberg for paving the way on this!\r\n\r\nAlso closes https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/4309\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThis PR improves SSR hydration performance through minimizing DOM mutations during hydration by avoiding de- and reattaching nodes during hydration. This should fix #1067, fix #4308, fix #5108, and fix #4975.\r\n\r\nIn order for this to work I added a new new \"hydration mode\". This way it's possible to maintain the detach by default behavior during hydration without modifying the generated component output. There might be better ways to do this if we reconsider fragment creation (as suggested in #3898 and #4219) but that would be a significant undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe existing append, insert and detached methods have been modified to track which nodes are claimed during hydration. That way unclaimed nodes can then removed from the DOM at the end of hydration without touching the remaining nodes.\r\n\r\nIn order for this to work the append, insert and detach methods have also been made idempotent (i.e. \"upserts\") in order to allow attaching an already attached DOM node.\r\n\r\n### Results \r\n\r\nInitial local benchmarks against johnells.se (which runs on Sapper) shows a 50% reduction of LCP when running Lighthouse, which results in decent PageSpeed score improvement.\r\n\r\nProduction benchmarks on the SvelteKit app at https://c3.ventures/ show a PageSpeed score improvement from 92 to 99.",

Because .svelte files really embrace the basic web-technologies, it made frameworks so much more accessible! I was always deterred from becoming a web-developer due to (perceived) complexity, but svelte finally opened up this possibility for me! Thank you!\r\n\r\nBecause I am relatively new, please make sure to double check my code for bad practices or coding errors!\r\nPlease point out to me if I made any formal errors with this PR besides the test cases I was to inexperienced to write.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason.\r\n\r\nI created an issue for this feature request myself earlier today: #6182 . \r\nBasically, I am proposing to expand the parameters the slide transition takes in, in order to allow for the sliding animation to occur on two axes: horizontally or vertically. Slide provides a beautiful and realistic user experience. However, it is limited in terms of usability, because out of the box it only supports vertical sliding.\r\nUsing the slide transition horizontally creates a really beautiful effect, that resembles a slide of cards and is directionally aligned with back arrows, text flow and other UI components.\r\nThis is a feature worth including into svelte, because the \"batteries included\" rich transition suite is a key factor in developer experience. This PR strives to make a preexisting transition more versatile, by adding an optional parameter to the API without breaking the default behavior.\r\n\r\nYou can see this implementation in action [in this REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/6d5239f09b0b4dc6aafeb70606a0fe94?version=3.46.4), albeit without typescript.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Update Documentation\r\n\r\nBecause the API changed, I updated the Documentation. I hope the format and wording is appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Assistance required: Tests\r\n-  [x] Run the tests with `npm test` and lint the project with `npm run lint`\r\n-  [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\nBoth `npm test` and `npm run lint` ran without hiccups. However, i failed to implement my own tests to test my solution. \r\nI would highly appreciate it, if someone could point me to introductory ressources for writing tests, so that I can submit them later.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Updated REPL",

It does not break existing tests and the only test I see would be to check that we have the `source` param available in the `preprocess` function. *(it seems pretty useless)*\r\n\r\nDo you want me to add this test?\r\n\r\n##### Question\r\n\r\nI asked this question in the `svelte-preprocess` issue referenced before:\r\n\r\nIs there a safe way (no regexp) to extract JS expressions (or variables) from markup without doing a full svelte compilation?\r\n\r\n##### Update\r\n\r\nI see that the windows+node v8 test failed because of a timout issue. I think that it's only an outage on Github. Is it possible to rerun this job to ensure that everything is OK?\r\n\r\n*Since all others tests are successful, I think there is no problem, but I like green ticks :-)*\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [X] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [X] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n-  [X] Run the tests with `npm test` and lint the project with `npm run lint`\r\n",

There was a strong leaning toward leveraging some existing newsletter tooling run by the community so it doesn't become a maintenance burden for the core contributors/maintainers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to introduce a signup form onto the main blog site so that folks who come to the blog can be notified.Substack's built-in signup embed lets us do this easily.  We are getting content into substack by copying and pasting the monthly blog post into the substack WYSIWYG editor. We could possibly use this same approach to notify subscribers of other blog posts.\r\n\r\nThere are currently ~300 subscribers on the substack newsletter and we've been cross-posting the content from the svelte.dev blog for the past few months.\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n-  [ ] Add any maintainers and/or SvelteSociety community members as admins to the substack\r\n-  [ ] Update the name & logo of the substack to not be \"unofficial\", since it'll be run by the community\r\n-  [ ] Add a \"subscribe via RSS\" link below the email signup to the blog's RSS option more prominent\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nIf the person is already logged into substack:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7872348/113487899-85ae3780-946f-11eb-89e9-1f474c87acc3.png)\r\n\r\nIf the person is not logged in to substack (signup does not require a substack account):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7872348/113487921-a1194280-946f-11eb-9ce8-466dda102770.png)\r\n\r\nOn mobile, the signup appears at the bottom of the blogs posts:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7872348/113487913-93fc5380-946f-11eb-975d-2726656c5858.png)\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n- Do we need pagination on the blog soon?\r\n- Who needs access to the substack admin? Currently I'm the only admin.\r\n- Should we publish all blog posts via substack? Or just the monthly ones?\r\n",

        "body": "This allows for developers to ensure that certain `markup` functions\r\nare run *after* other `script` or `style` functions have run.\r\n\r\n~I will take care of further addition of tests and whatnot if there is agreement that this is a feature worth having.~ I couldn't resist making the tests pass. \ud83d\ude05 \r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nSome preprocessors need to run against the `markup` function to be useful. In the particular case of [Svelte Image](https://github.com/matyunya/svelte-image), it uses the `markup` function to gain access to the whole component, then uses `svelte.parse` to get an AST.\r\n\r\nBut whoops! If you like developing with Typescript, Svelte Image won't work for you because Typescript isn't removed until the `script` phase of the preprocessor function, and `svelte.parse` doesn't understand Typescript.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nPreprocessors that _really_ need access to `markup` after all other processors have finished could be forced last in this way (again with svelte image as the example)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst svelte = require(\"svelte/compiler\")\r\nconst sveltePreprocess = require(\"svelte-preprocess\")\r\nconst image = require(\"svelte-image\")\r\n\r\n// Ask developers to define this function or something like it:\r\nfunction runOthersBeforeImage(otherProcessors) {\r\n  return {\r\n    markup: async ({ content, filename }) => {\r\n      const otherProcessorsReturn = await svelte.preprocess(\r\n        content,\r\n        otherProcessors,\r\n        { filename },\r\n      )\r\n      content = otherProcessorsReturn.code\r\n\r\n      const { code } = await image({}).markup({ content, filename })\r\n      return {\r\n        ...otherProcessorsReturn,\r\n        code,\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  preprocess: [\r\n    runOthersBeforeImage(\r\n      sveltePreprocess({\r\n        defaults: {\r\n          style: \"postcss\",\r\n        },\r\n        postcss: true,\r\n      }),\r\n    ),\r\n  ],\r\n  // ... other stuff\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this solution works, but wouldn't we be calling `svelte.preprocess` more than necessary, ultimately? not sure if that has any downsides. Like maybe you lose all sense of \"who did what\" when it comes to dependencies and source maps. But I could be wrong. I don't know a whole lot about the internals of Svelte, but I do know that if we were to nest everything, all the processing would be done against one instance of `PreprocessResult`, instead of multiple ones.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if my proposal isn't up to snuff, we should at least consider adding documentation that points people toward the workaround above, since this issue comes up from time to time.\r\n\r\n## My proposal: allow nested preprocessors\r\n\r\nHere is my addition to the documentation:\r\n\r\n> An additional level of nesting allows more control over the timing of subsequent `markup` functions.\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> const svelte = require('svelte/compiler');\r\n> \r\n> const { code } = await svelte.preprocess(source, [\r\n> \t[\r\n> \t\t{\r\n> \t\t\tmarkup: () => {\r\n> \t\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs first');\r\n> \t\t\t},\r\n> \t\t\tscript: () => {\r\n> \t\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs third');\r\n> \t\t\t},\r\n> \t\t\tstyle: () => {\r\n> \t\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs fifth');\r\n> \t\t\t}\r\n> \t\t},\r\n> \t\t{\r\n> \t\t\tmarkup: () => {\r\n> \t\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs second');\r\n> \t\t\t},\r\n> \t\t\tscript: () => {\r\n> \t\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs fourth');\r\n> \t\t\t},\r\n> \t\t\tstyle: () => {\r\n> \t\t\t\tconsole.log('this runs sixth');\r\n> \t\t\t}\r\n> \t\t}\r\n> \t],\r\n> \t{\r\n> \t\tmarkup: () => {\r\n> \t\t\tconsole.log('this runs seventh');\r\n> \t\t},\r\n> \t\tscript: () => {\r\n> \t\t\tconsole.log('this runs eighth');\r\n> \t\t},\r\n> \t\tstyle: () => {\r\n> \t\t\tconsole.log('this runs ninth');\r\n> \t\t}\r\n> \t}\r\n> ], {\r\n> \tfilename: 'App.svelte'\r\n> });\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nMy main goal here is to get this pushed all the way into the config files for Svelte, Sapper, and SvelteKit projects. I am _guessing_ that this is either the exact way to do it, or that it is the start of that goal.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

I don't know why. Maybe switching this order would break something else. Maybe there are cases where the elements have to be added to the DOM before the event listeners are attached (maybe in order to prevent an event handler to fire at an incorrect time?)... I am lost.\r\n\r\nSo, bottom line: I don't know why the mount code is being generated in this order. Does it matter, for reasons that I cannot see?\r\n- If that is the case, which other ways could we solve this issue?\r\n- If that is NOT the case, can the failing test be rewritten?\r\n",

I haven't been in the code-base for a while and to add this a parameter needs to be added to the `resize_observer` function (the observer entries) so they can be set in the binding.

This is on a few permalinks that have `aria-hidden=\"\"` instead of `aria-hidden=\"true\"`.\r\n- [Links must have discernible text](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.0/link-name?application=AxeChrome) (5 count). Permalinks did not have any text.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I removed aria-hidden from the permalinks and added visually hidden text to indicate the purpose of the link.

Full testsuite and linter was run, no breaking changes discovered.\r\n\r\nIn broader terms, the syntax of doing `xxx:={...}`, that is, to have an \"empty\" binding, class name, etc should perhaps always be a compile error. For some cases, it already is, for example, for `bind:`, another part of the code will see that the binding name is empty, and compilation will fail (of course, for `bind:` in particular, the compiler checks that the thing you're binding to makes sense. For `class:`, class names can be literally anything, and so the same code for testing that case is not used in the code that I have so far. So anyway, I suggest that there could perhaps be a cleaner way to implement a general fix for these \"empty directives\" (i.e. where there is nothing after the colon, like ni `xxx:={...}`). But it could also be that I am mistaken in saying that the `:=` syntax is always incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR, so be civil in your replies :)",

Set source of preprocessed file as basename (relative to itself - \"from\" and \"to\" is the same file in case of preprocess - also fixed weird paths like src/src/Input.svelte after remapping)\r\n2. Apply offset only to segments pointing at component source file\r\n3. Offset segments with first original line, not generated one\r\n4. Align count of generated sourcemap lines with count of code lines in generated code (should fix https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess/issues/286)\r\n5. Compute last line length before mutating source\r\n6. Replace if(seg[N]) with more explicit length checks to avoid false positives on zero indexes\r\n7. Treat returned content without map as not changed\r\n\r\nI would appreciate feedback on this.

To illustrate:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresize-bound element: z-index: 100\r\n|- child: z-index: auto\r\n|- child: z-index: auto\r\n|- iframe: z-index: 99 <-- layers above the children\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough the `<iframe>` has `pointer-events: none`, it still blocks scrolling on child elements in certain browsers, namely macOS Safari and iOS browsers:\r\n\r\nPrior to [this diff](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/2989/files#diff-7ad300a4efc821b2576200a7bfc99205d558792b81c037fbc20f9236f8b6f1bbL243), the `<iframe>` was assigned `z-index: -1`, which effectively layers it below any children elements.\r\n\r\n**Screenshot**:\r\n\r\n![101125889-29193980-35af-11eb-9f75-8ab86aead056](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31055081/101201997-792ee500-361d-11eb-8f02-068661c355c1.gif)\r\n\r\n**Solution**:\r\n\r\nThis change reverts back to setting the `<iframe>` to `z-index: -1` which no longer obscures children of the bound element.",

However, this had accessibility issues because keyboard-only users had no way to scroll the code blocks and would be unable to see part of the examples.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this would be to add `tabindex=\"0\"` to all code blocks to allow them to be focused and scrolled. However, this would make all 200+ code blocks in the documentation tab stops, even when they don't overflow. This could make it more tedious to navigate the docs using the keyboard. In addition, [focusable elements must have an accessible name](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#fifth), which the code blocks do not have.\r\n\r\nBecause of these issues, I instead chose to force the code blocks to wrap instead of overflowing. This doesn't affect many code blocks when viewing the docs on a desktop, because the screen is wide enough to fit most lines. The code blocks wrap more aggressively on mobile, but they are still readable. IMO, this is an acceptable trade-off to make sure the docs are accessible to as many people as possible.\r\n\r\nExample wrapping on desktop:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4992896/100137007-a7077300-2e40-11eb-8b62-cb7b4601409e.png)\r\n\r\nExample wrapping on mobile:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4992896/100136982-9c4cde00-2e40-11eb-98ab-8b0ca75a5506.png)\r\n\r\n",

For example, the first sentence is\r\n\r\n> [...] when you modify the value of an each block [...]\r\n\r\nWhat is \"a value of an each block\"? I think \"a value of the array that the `#each` block iterates over\" would be much clearer.\r\n\r\nAlso, the example wasn't very easy to understand.\r\n- It's not visually clear that each row corresponds to an instance of the  `<Thing>` component and not each box. I tried to visually separate each row to make that more clear.\r\n- Although colors are nice to immediately see differences, I found it hard to make sense of which color corresponds to which element of the array. I think numbers are simpler and easier to keep track of.\r\n- It's confusing that the array `things` is named identically to the component `<Thing>`. I think the name \"array\" for the array and \"element\" for its elements make it clearer.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample, after clicking 2 times the \"Remove first element\" button. Note how with numbers you immediately see that the first two elements are missing, while with colors it's harder to spot.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33468089/99544456-9f654b80-29b4-11eb-92c6-b10a792064ba.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33468089/99544453-9d9b8800-29b4-11eb-99f6-0cfbddc592a5.png\">\r\n\r\nI hope my proposed changes makes this chapter much easier to understand.",

        "body": "#### What\r\nImprove support for non HTML usage of svelte (eg Svelte Native and Svelte node-gui) by retaining the original attribute case when calling `setAttribute` \r\n(This supersedes https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/5387 as a more comprehensive solution)\r\n\r\n#### Why \r\nSvelte Native has been around since Svelte 3 providing support for writing native mobile applications in Svelte. Svelte node-gui is a new project which supports writing native desktop apps (Node-Gui/Qt) in Svelte. \r\n\r\nBoth projects require the original attribute case to set properties on their native elements. This is currently achieved by [reflecting over the native objects to find the correct casing](https://github.com/halfnelson/svelte-native/blob/master/src/dom/native/NativeElementNode.ts#L60) which is less than ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How\r\nSvelte Native has always injected a custom namespace `xmlns=\"tns\"` into the top level element of a svelte component. This was needed to prevent svelte from generating `.innerHtml = ` code in the component. This PR introduces an official supported namespace `external` which allows tools handling non html5 dom to inject `<svelte:options namespace=\"extermal\" />`\r\n\r\nLike the custom handling that applies to elements that are in the SVG and other custom namespaces (eg MathML), the `external` namespace is used to opt out of attribute name lowercasing.\r\n\r\n#### Next Steps\r\nIf this PR lands, svelte-native and svelte node-gui etc will need to change themselves to insert a svelte options tag with namespace set to \"external\", and any code that normalizes that attribute names will need to be removed. \r\n\r\n**EDIT**: This PR originally proposed a \"native\" namespace, and skipped a11y checks when present. The PR has been updated to add an \"external\" namespace to make it more general. It only impacts case sensitivity of attributes. A11y warnings for external namespaces will need to be solved in another manner",

This should fix #1067, #4308 and parts of #5108.\r\n\r\nIn order for this to work I added a new new \"hydration mode\". This way it's possible to maintain the detach by default behavior during hydration without modifying the generated component output. There might be better ways to do this if we reconsider fragment creation (as suggested in #3898 and #4219) but that would be a significant undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe existing append, insert and detached methods have been modified to track which nodes are claimed during hydration. That way unclaimed nodes can then removed from the DOM at the end of hydration without touching the remaining nodes.\r\n\r\nIn order for this to work the append, insert and detach methods have also been made idempotent (i.e. \"upserts\") in order to allow attaching an already attached DOM node.\r\n\r\nFinally I also added some basic logging of hydration errors to the console.\r\n\r\n### Results \r\n\r\nInitial local benchmarks against johnells.se (which runs on Sapper) shows a 50% reduction of LCP when running Lighthouse, which results in decent PageSpeed score improvement.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add test case",

The main letdown is the debug story. Svelte component source maps ignore the preprocessing that takes place making it impossible to do meaningful debugging via the web dev tools.\r\n\r\n#### How\r\nWe use https://github.com/ampproject/remapping a small and synchronous source map combiner (Based on feedback on #1863)\r\n\r\nSome manual source map merging is done in the context of Script and Style preprocessor results using a small set of utility functions developed for that purpose.\r\n\r\nSample level tests have been written to prove the flow.\r\n\r\n#### Next Steps\r\nThe bundler plugins/loaders will need to be made aware of the sourcemap compiler option and pass in any preprocessor results (e.g. https://github.com/sveltejs/rollup-plugin-svelte/pull/140)\r\n\r\nApply the developer mode warnings and encode/decode optimizations from #5428",

        "body": "This PR is based of #2324 and implements a new tag in Svelte called `<svelte:element>`. This is used to dynamically render a HTML tag where you don't know the type upfront.\r\n\r\n### Use cases\r\nWhen rendering data from a CMS you may end up with a structure looking like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"type\": \"div\",\r\n    \"children\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"h1\",\r\n        \"children\": [\"Lorem ipsum\"]\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"type\": \"p\",\r\n        \"children\": [\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam rhoncus accumsan sollicitudin. Proin accumsan id eros nec placerat. Maecenas ullamcorper ullamcorper nisi.\"]\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way to render this today is by creating a Svelte component that renders the corresponding HTML tag by [defining all of them](https://svelte.dev/repl/42290cfe8bae4dee4df232669d12dc29?version=3.0.0-beta.21). However, this adds a lot of boilerplate and unnecessary weight to the compiled bundle. The implemented solution in this PR solves this problem.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe `<svelte:element>` takes a special property called `tag`, which is the type of DOM element you want to render (e.g. div, h1 etc). All other props/attributes are passed through to the DOM element itself, meaning you can use it just like you would use any HTML element.\r\n\r\n#### Example: Passing tag as a string\r\n```svelte\r\n<svelte:element tag=\"div\">\r\n  This is rendered as a regular div.\r\n</svelte:element>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example: Passing tag as a variable\r\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n  export let tag = 'h1';\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<svelte:element {tag} {...$$props}>\r\n  This renders as whatever is passed as a prop to this component and forwards any props supplied.\r\n</svelte:element>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\nThe implementation is based on the works of erzr (see PR #3928) as well as the new implementation of the {#key} block. It works with ssr and hydration.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new Node type called DynamicElement that wraps the regular Element implementation. The Element node has also been extended with a prop called `dynamic_tag`, which is used instead of the name to render the element, if this is present.\r\n\r\nWhen the tag is changed the element is destroyed and a new one is created. If other props change except the tag, the element is re-used.\r\n\r\nThe server side implementation of DynamicElement is a copy of the Element implementation, with one important difference. Since we don't know upfront what kind of HTML element this is, we cannot do many of the optimizations/special cases (e.g. handling events in different ways depending on the element type or having textarea content be set both via value and as children). I think these tradeoffs are okay, since most of the time this should be used with more or less \"static\" content (if you want to have full control of it, you should probably create a Svelte component for this anyway).\r\n\r\n### Remaining\r\n\r\n- [x] Add to documentation\r\n",

This makes sure that the check for whether there is only a single animating child passes.\r\n\r\nI guess this means there's a risk that the semantics change subtly if animating inline blocks: you might expect them to be separated by whitespace but they won't be. On the other hand, since we don't support having more than one element animating it's kind of unavoidable. One could conceivably fix this by adding a `<span>` around the whole output, but I can't overview the consequences of that.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

major changes\r\n\r\n* bugfix in fn merge_tables (see end of comment)\r\n* optimize: skip unnecessary encode+decode steps\r\n   * between `res.get_sourcemap()` and `remapping(sourcemap_list)` - make preprocess 20% faster in benchmark\r\n   * between `svelte.preprocess` and `svelte.compile` - waiting for https://github.com/Rich-Harris/code-red/pull/51 and https://github.com/ampproject/remapping/pull/88\r\n* use the [loader interface of remapping](https://github.com/ampproject/remapping/issues/85#issuecomment-700568327) to support any number of source files = convergent transform chains with multiple bundle steps\r\n\r\ndone - small changes\r\n\r\n* fix suggestions by benmccann in request 5015\r\n* rename variables\r\n* rephrase comments\r\n* indent with tabs\r\n* micro optimize: skip column-shifting if offset is zero\r\n* verified edge case: when concatting code segments, and when the first segment ends with a newline (empty line), then offset (for column-shifting) is zero\r\n* move functions `replace_async` and `get_replacement` to global scope, make pure fn, avoid using global vars\r\n* refactor sourcemap tests, move _preprocess.js to _config.js, rename variables, etc\r\n* fix test preprocess/filename. `preprocessors.filename` is ignored if `options.filename` is set\r\n* handle sourcemap.names, dont just return empty array\r\n* add test: sourcemap with `names` field, verify merging and remapping of map.names  \r\nnames is an array of original symbol names that were changed in the transform (sample: terser.minify)\r\n* micro optimize: use mutable data, ~~much faster than immutable~~\r\n   * replace array.concat with array.push\r\n   * avoid `array1.push(...array2)` which is limited by max call stack size of ~100K\r\n* micro optimize: unswitch loops, javascript does not do this for us - cost: more code\r\n* bugfix in `test/setup.js` - support default + named import\r\n* show warning on unnecessary `decode_mappings`. `svelte.compile` prefers to consume decoded mappings - transcoding of mappings is expensive\r\n* return `css.map.version = 3` in svelte.compile. solved by workaround. magic-string type DecodedSourceMap should have property `version`\r\n* rebase to master -> https://github.com/milahu/svelte/tree/add-preprocessor-sourcemaps-rebased-to-ebbbc0d\r\n* optimize: use for loops on large arrays - [much faster](http://jsbench.github.io/#6f65c587af9277325bcda0e69ba44d5f) than functional loops\r\n* fix css remap, this must be done earlier in render_dom and render_ssr, so map.toUrl() etc can use the combined map - add test sourcemaps/compile-option-dev\r\n\r\nremoved\r\n\r\n* show warning on potential low-resolution sourcemaps. these can make older mappings unreachable, so every preprocessor in the chain should return high-resolution sourcemaps. problem: this can not be reliably detected\r\n\r\ntodo\r\n\r\n* cleanup commits. one to refactor tests + one to add feature preprocessor sourcemaps\r\n* optimize: [make code-red return decoded mappings](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/code-red/issues/50). currently, mappings are encoded by code-red and decoded by `compile/Component.ts`\r\n* optimize: [make remapping return decoded mappings](https://github.com/ampproject/remapping/pull/88). currently, mappings are encoded by remapping and decoded by `string_with_sourcemap.ts`\r\n* optimize \"remapping\" (combining of sourcemaps). the current format of decoded mappings (dense arrays, indexed by line and segment) is not optimal for this purpose (many lookups). currently we need binarySearch for lookup by line and column. better would be a data-structure indexed by line and column. converting between line-segment format and line-column format would be overhead, we need the sourcemap-generator to directly generate the optimized line-column format. see https://github.com/Rich-Harris/sourcemap-codec/issues/82 for possible solutions\r\n\r\ntodo - document\r\n\r\n* preprocessors must generate high-resolution sourcemaps, so all segments can be traced back to original source files. this condition (hires maps) can not be easily tested by svelte, we would have to tokenize source files and compare with sourcemap.mappings = probably out of scope, rather users should fix their tools\r\n* recommend returning decoded sourcemaps in preprocessor, to avoid unnecessary encode+decode steps\r\n* show how to do multiple bundle steps. the bundle file must always have the filename `ThisComponent.svelte`. limitation: included files must be 'original source files' = leaf nodes = can not have sourcemaps\r\n* on next release, update section svelte.preprocess: \"In current versions of Svelte it will be ignored, but future versions of Svelte may take account of preprocessor sourcemaps.\"\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>bugfix in fn merge_tables</summary>\r\n\r\n`map.sources[1]` was returning `undefined`\r\nthis was a bug in fn merge_tables, fixed in b7d5974 \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n function merge_tables<T>(original: T[], extended: T[]): { table: T[]; new_idx: number[] } {\r\n   const table = original.slice();\r\n   const new_idx = [];\r\n-  for (let j = 0; j < original.length; j++) {\r\n+  for (let j = 0; j < extended.length; j++) {\r\n     const current = extended[j];\r\n     const existing = table.indexOf(current);\r\n     if (existing < 0) {\r\n       table.push(current);\r\n       new_idx[j] = table.length -

If there is worry about side-effects of #4909, this one could first be accepted into a bug-fix release to be potentially replaced with #4909 in a more major release.\r\n\r\nThe only place where this PR resets the current component is after `flush()` is called from a `Promise.resolve().then(...)` in `scheduler.ts`, so only when called from the microtask queue, not from other Svelte code.  In seemingly every other location (eg. await_block.ts), Svelte is resetting the current component at the end of a microtask, so this seems like a clear oversight.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for maintaining this great library!

There is still a few things related to transitions from that PR, none of them are breaking\r\n\r\n* New frame callback system keeps track of all pending tasks to shrink work performed each frame (previously iterating over a Set calling each animation) down to as little as one timestamp check\r\n\r\n* Measurements and animations are now batched to be applied after flush, this avoids layout trashing and significantly improves performance in same tick tasks performing several DOM reads\r\nThis is the cause of most changed tests as it was expected for animations to be applied synchronously\r\nFixes #4732\r\n\r\n* Position freeze is now reversed if re-introed, \r\nfixes transition + animate where a node would hide behind others, fixes #4910, fixes #6001\r\n\r\n* Bidi transitions now recompute on every run, fixes #4784, fixes #4831\r\n     * To further customization, if a bidi config returns a function it will now be called with a `is_intro` boolean, related #4019\r\n\r\n* Bidi transitions now handle several delay reversals, fixes #4968\r\n     * Handling delay properly while also recomputing on every run requires to know whether a config has delay before running the transition function ( as its measurements cannot be delayed ), so on init and every time a config changes there is a dry run to scan for the delay parameter. If config returns a function it is called with `is_intro` `undefined`\r\n![ezgif-4-27ff836ebf74](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30108880/84243612-bef17180-ab02-11ea-89b3-17e06a63117c.gif)\r\n\r\n* Fixed concurrency bugs related to bidi transitions reversal, fixes #4974, fixes #4954\r\n* Added `rotate` option to `fly` transition, rewrote `svelte/transition` types\r\n\r\nnotes\r\n\r\n- motion still uses the old loop system, I started rewriting some of it using motion stores from #4742 but I doubt anyone using the current implementation is concerned about performance\r\n- transitions could be DRYer, and bidi are heavy on GC\r\n- `@rollup/plugin-typescript` has to be updated to properly inline `const enum`\r\n\r\ntodo\r\n\r\nRemove transition easing strategies ( cool but unnecessary )\r\nWrite tests for fixed bugs\r\n\r\nCan't work on this for some time but it's there if someone needs it, it's all yours",

This results in a water-fall effect, which can severely slow loading speeds for SSR applications:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17972275/82304962-30566c80-99fc-11ea-83ec-c598aa0802ed.png)\r\n\r\nThis is an essential feature to support for enterprise applications that require async routing and SSR and will increase loading speeds for apps that require asynchronous/dynamic imports\r\n\r\nThis method has been proven to work effectively, as VueJS uses a similar implementation. \r\nhttps://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/bundle-renderer.html#enter-bundlerenderer\r\n\r\nI have implemented an ideal scenario that results in 100/100 lighthouse score for apps with SSR, this is not currently possible with SSR apps that use async components\r\n\r\nContext: https://twitter.com/PromatiaGov/status/1262183956004220928",

Everything is internal, no changes.\r\n\r\n## BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n### svelte/motion\r\n\r\nRewrote everything\r\n\r\n### Springs\r\n\r\n* The spring implementation now uses the [damped harmonic oscillation equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator#Damped_harmonic_oscillator), this is how springs are computed on iOS, React Native, Framer Motion, probably Android too. \r\n* Breaking : `damping` now ranges from `0.1 to 20`, `stiffness` now ranges `from 10 to 200`, `soft` and `hard` are not a thing anymore\r\n* `mass` : new parameter, scales the equation uniformly, see [graphing](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/urztjwk4dv) for reference.\r\n* `soft` : new parameter, forces the spring to match a critically damped oscillation, i.e. gently transitions without oscillating.\r\n* `.setImmediate` : new method, sets value immediately, sets velocity to 0.\r\n* `.onRest` : new method, the passed callback is called every time the spring settles, returns an unsubscriber.\r\n* `.set` : does not return a Promise anymore, returns a thenable instead. Effectively what this means is that you cannot use `.catch` on it, everything else works like a Promise would.\r\n\r\n### Tweens\r\n\r\n* breaking : `tweened` does not interpolate between dates automatically anymore.\r\n* `.setImmediate` : new method, sets value immediately.\r\n* `.onRest` : new method, the passed callback is called every time the tween settles, returns an unsubscriber.\r\n* `.set` : does not return a Promise anymore, returns a thenable instead. Effectively what this means is that you cannot use `.catch` on it, everything else works like a Promise would.\r\n\r\n## New packages\r\n\r\n### [rolled back] ~~svelte/environment~~\r\nEnvironment checks & variables are slowly stacking up and as a front-end framework it only makes sense to expose them\r\n* `globals`\r\n* `is_browser` : simple `window` check\r\n* `framerate` : milliseconds per frame, used in css keyframe generation as well as in `svelte/motion`\r\n* `now` : `performance.now` or `Date.now` depending on the environment\r\n* `is_iframe` : true when run inside an iframe.\r\n* `is_cors` : true when run inside a cross domain iframe, used in `add_resize_listener` internally.\r\n* `has_Symbol` : true when the environment supports Symbols. Used in a dev check internally.\r\n* for testing purposes : `set_framerate`, `set_raf`, `set_now`\r\n\r\n### svelte/interpolate\r\nNew package for tween interpolation.\r\n* `numbers` : interpolate between numbers.\r\n* `strings` : interpolate between strings of constant shape with variable numbers.\r\n* `dates` : interpolate between dates.\r\n\r\n## svelte.dev/examples\r\n\r\n#### Animations\r\n\r\n- Added shuffling while holding spacebar\r\n\r\n#### Springs\r\n\r\n- Added playtesting ( https://twitter.com/pushkine_/status/1262873901715111936 )\r\n\r\n#### Easing Visualizer\r\n\r\n- Tweaks + Cubic B\u00e9zier ( https://twitter.com/pushkine_/status/1262859622806945793 )\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's left\r\n\r\nEvery test is passing except for a few ones whose folder name has `.skip` in it. All are seemingly unrelated to the changes, I failed every attempt to fix them, but they are legitimate. Need to write a bunch of tests too, waiting for feedback\r\n",

        "body": "This PR implements an alternative approach to consuming slots through the use of a new `$$slots` variable. The need for something like this has been brought up several times see #2106 and to a lesser extent #4036 there's a few more related issues scattered around.\r\n\r\n# $$slots\r\n\r\n`$$slots` is an object keyed by slot name containing slot constructors of the form `slot_name(ctx?: Object, callback?: Function)`. \r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\n`ctx` is an optional parameter to set the inital context of the slot. Equivalent to passing props to a `<slot />` node.\r\n\r\n`callback` is also optional. It's a callback function that will be called when slot content changes. \r\n\r\n## Return value\r\n\r\nThe constructor returns an object of the form \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  content: Array<HTMLElement|TextNode|Component>,\r\n  mount: Function(target: HTMLElement, anchor?: HTMLElement),\r\n  update: Function(props: Object),\r\n  destroy: Function\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`content` is an array containing the top level nodes. Some more work is needed to support if, each, and await blocks.\r\n\r\nThe `mount` function can be called to insert the slot content into the DOM. Note that this isn't required, you could do whatever you want with the content.\r\n\r\nYou can call `update` to modify the context you initially passed in. This is similar to `Component.$set`.\r\n\r\nThe `destroy` function removes the content from the dom.\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\nSetting a textarea from slot content.\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  export let value = $$slots.default().content[0].data\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<textarea bind:value></textarea>\r\n```\r\n\r\nA react style portal component.\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  import { onDestroy } from 'svelte'\r\n\r\n  const slot =  $$slots.default()\r\n  slot.mount(document.body)\r\n  onDestroy(slot.destroy)\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nA nav element that sets the `active` class on child ancher elements.\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  export let path\r\n\r\n  $: {\r\n    if (target) {\r\n      const slot = $$slots.default()\r\n      slot.content.forEach(n =>\r\n        n.tagName == 'A'\r\n        && n.getAttribute('href') == path\r\n        && n.classList.add('active')\r\n      )\r\n      slot.mount(target)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n<nav bind:this={target} />\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "### Description\r\nDo not null blocks after out transition in await block.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIf the `then` block has `out` transition, it takes some time for it to \"disappear\". After the update of `pending` block, `then` block is being transitioned out. If the promise is then resolved, `then` block is updated and `pending` block is transitioned out and `then` block set as current. Only after that, the `then`'s transition out (triggered by the update of `pending` block) finishes and the corresponding block info is being nulled. \r\n\r\nThat results in a situation where await block is in `then` state, but `then` entry in `blocks` field is null. Therefore it is not transitioned out during the next `pending` block update.\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\nI found the original commit which introduced nulling out the transitioned blocks. It's almost 2 years ago by @Rich-Harris in [1d3b1284eaecf2d09557d883b0db3adbab48f633](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/commit/1d3b1284eaecf2d09557d883b0db3adbab48f633) but I don't know what was the original motivation, so I am afraid this change/revert might break something :(\r\n\r\n### Related issue\r\nFixes #1591 \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- All the tests are passing.\r\n- I tried to write a test, but was not successful.\r\n",

Run onMount in `connectedCallback`\r\n2. Register return values from `onMount` as `on_disconnect` and run them in `disconnectedCallback`\r\n3. Not resetting `on_mount` after initial run\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n1. Props are initialised when `onMount` happens (no more `tick().then(/**/)`). Maps closer to mental model of a custom element.\r\n2. We can clean up (prevent memory leaks) without changing how a normal Svelte component behaves. Note that `onDestroy` is still not called.\r\n3. If component is disconnected and then reinserted, callbacks would run again, generating fresh clean up callbacks.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```html\r\n<svelte:options tag=\"x-tag\"/>\r\n<script>\r\n  import { onMount } from 'svelte';\r\n\r\n  export let disabled = false;\r\n\r\n  onMount(() => {\r\n    console.log('will be called by connectedCallback');\r\n    console.log(disabled); // \"\" (empty string, if set like this: <x-tag disabled/>)\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      console.log('will be called by disconnectedCallback');\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n",

It's because there is both a RAF running and a `timeupdate` event listener. The RAF stops when the media is `paused` but the `timeupdate` event fires one last time after it is `paused` with a slightly different value. This causes `currentTime` to be dirty and the update block calls `audio.currentTime = currentTime` which causes a `seeking` event to be fired.\r\n\r\nNote: apologies I created a new PR by accident as the other one was forced closed.",

        "body": "Even with the project having a `.eslintrc` and a `.prettierrc`, I noticed some spacing, quoting and other types of simple inconsistencies throughout the codebase. A repo this big, with a growing number of contributors, can benefit from having an enforced coding style guide. Implementations and PR reviews can be much quicker if everyone is formatting their code in the same way. \r\n\r\nIn this PR I added `husky` and `lint-staged` which helps guaranteeing that all parts of modified files (it works with partial commits!) are linted and formatted according to the project's config. \r\n\r\n- Added `husky` to easily access git-hooks\r\n- Added `lint-staged` to lint only what is being staged in a commit (also works with `git add -p`)\r\n- Added `eslint-plugin-prettier`/`eslint-config-prettier` to enforce the rules defined on the `.prettierrc` file\r\n- Created a `.prettierignore` file to ignore files that shouldn't be formatted by prettier.\r\n\r\nI understand that this configs can lead to a LOT of changes if merged, since a bunch of files are not exactly following the linter/formatter config, but I really think it's worth the small trouble of running a `eslint --fix && prettier --write` in the whole project at some point.\r\n\r\nHere's a PR example with the whole project formatted for comparison reasons: https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte/pull/1/files. I used `prettier` default options, which means a `printWidth` of `80` characters per line. Personally I find 80 characters much more readable, but the project could use `100` and be a little less aggressively formatted.\r\n\r\n### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following\r\n- [ ] ~It's really useful if your PR relates to an outstanding issue, so please reference it in your PR, or create an explanatory one for discussion.

        "body": "This is based on the pull request #4073 and issue #1748\r\n\r\nThe idea is to allow web components to render to light dom. As this may be something you don't want to do for all components within an app the option is included as part of the svelte:options tag.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svelte:options tag=\"my-app\" shadowdom=\"none\" />\r\n```\r\nFor completeness I've also included \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svelte:options tag=\"my-app\" shadowdom=\"none\" />\r\n<svelte:options tag=\"my-app\" shadowdom=\"open\" />\r\n<svelte:options tag=\"my-app\" shadowdom=\"closed\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main reason I have for needing light dom is to be able to create forms which auto-complete correctly as this currently doesn't work with shadow dom in chrome and safari. Though there are open tickets for this with the browsers. (eg https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=746593)\r\n\r\nIf the tag is set to `shadowdom=\"none\"` the css is processed as though it's a svelte element with the class addition and hashes, which gives some level of encapsulation even with light dom.\r\n\r\nOutstanding on this is slots. Not sure how these can be handled with light dom as Sveltes html is being appended to the innerHTML of the tag, as opposed to transposing the existing html into the slot. Lit-element just says if you don't use shadowdom you can't have slots or encapsulated css -  (https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/templates#renderroot). As svelte already simulate slots, it'd be nice to get this to work. Any pointers would be gladly received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Hi peeps,\r\n\r\nWe're in the middle of choosing a JS component wrapper for our design system. Svelte looks really good, best developer experience so far. Custom elements are an important part of this process because it allows teams to consume individual components in their own projects, which may then use React (even though it has known issues with custom elements, this library sorts them out for us https://github.com/BBKolton/reactify-wc/), Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a couple of issues with the way it handles custom elements (https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/1748)\r\n\r\nIt's important to be able to render elements directly on the lightdom due to accessibility issues.\r\n\r\nThese small changes solve that specific issue:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"331\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-12-09 21 02 26\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/844181/70426668-80351d00-1ac7-11ea-915a-2b94b91738e7.png\">\r\n<img width=\"290\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-12-09 21 02 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/844181/70426670-80cdb380-1ac7-11ea-8913-3506997026fc.png\">\r\n\r\nBut before looking deeper into this issue, I have a question that's more around what's the philosophy for Svelte:\r\n\r\nSafari does not support extending built-in elements (e.g. `<p is=\"my-svelte-component\">`). There is a (small) [polyfill](https://github.com/ungap/custom-elements-builtin) for Safari which is used in the [heresy project](https://github.com/WebReflection/heresy).\r\n\r\nLibraries like Stencil have no intention of adding polyfills for it, so I'm wondering; what's Svelte's stance on this?\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the point above, it's really important because it allows us to be able to progressively enhance a small component (such as an anchor or a paragraph) while keeping all the default attributes (like the aria- attributes) without having to re-implement them on each component.\r\n\r\nIf I'm completely missing something that already exists, or what I'm saying makes no sense at all, I'm also happy to be corrected.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",

        "body": "Replacing \"handleX\" with a more specific name that describes what the function does. This is to follow the \"clean coding\" best practice of naming functions by what they do.  In this case \"incrementCount\". It is much cleaner to know what a function does, and not relevant to know what triggered it to run.\r\n\r\nFor example, if later on I want another method to trigger this function\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction verifyIncrementAndSubmitCount () {\r\n  ensureCountIsAccurate();\r\n  handleClick();\r\n  submitCount();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case `handleClick` is confusing. It's telling me the original event that it was written to be called by, but now it is being called from two places. It would be easier to understand had it always had a descriptive name to begin with.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction verifyIncrementAndSubmitCount () {\r\n  ensureCountIsAccurate();\r\n  incrementCount();\r\n  submitCount();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a problem I've seen a lot in the React community. Fortunately the Vue community has been much better about it. I'd like to see the Svelte community be steered away from this unhelpful crutch of \"handle\" + event name.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n**Edit 1:**\r\n\r\n*This change is small, why not fix all of the documentation?*\r\n\r\nLogically my change should be as small and specific as possible, or should be as wide and complete as possible.\r\n\r\n*Why is the description so long then?*\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR/interaction with this repo. I'm unfamiliar with the maintainers and the community. I have no basis to go on for how they will react to this suggestion. It is better to have a description that is thorough and detailed to cover all edge cases and reasoning, to prevent bike-shedding.\r\n\r\n*Then why not be as \"wide and complete\" as possible for the PR too?*\r\n\r\nThis PR acts as a place for the community to discuss things such as:\r\n\r\n* How important clean code is to the community, this documentation, and the project source code.\r\n  * Perhaps the answer is \"none\", and the community is hostile towards these ideas. Then I would have only spent enough time to find that out, instead of converting the entire documentation and code base to have it rejected.\r\n  * Perhaps the answer is \"we care, but disagree with the reasoning in the description\". Then a clearer picture would be painted as to how the code could be improved stylistically to have better readability based on the community/maintainers input.\r\n\r\nIf I made the PR larger, then focus would be placed on every line, rather than the bigger concept. Once these bigger ideas are validated or corrected, then follow-up PR's can be made.\r\n\r\n> Why can't it just be renamed to `verifyAndIncrementCount`?\r\n> I think `BeforeSubmitting` doesn't fit here.\r\n> Or it can be `verifyAndIncrementAndSubmitCount`\r\n\r\nValid points. These changes are not in the PR, and were only given names to illustrate the point of why `handleX` is a poor naming convention to default to. I have changed this function's name to be more concise. In actual code I would prefer the function name to have some context as to *why* we are verifying, incrementing, and submitting a count.",

Workarounds for this issue result in large, incomplete wrapper components such as https://github.com/erzr/jss-svelte/blob/master/packages/jss-svelte/src/components/TagWrapper.svelte that just cover the most commonly used tags.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nA new element named `svelte:element` has been implemented that accepts a single prop `tag`, which could be a string or variable containing the tag name.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n`<svelte:element tag=\"h1\">This is an h1</svelte:element>`",

These properties return the intrinsic size of the video, so you can for example resize a `<canvas>` to match the size of the video:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<video bind:videoWidth={w} bind:videoHeight={h}>\r\n<canvas width={w} height={h}>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese bindings are updated whenever the `<video>` element fires a [`resize` event](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#event-media-resize). This caused a small issue, since we were already using the name `resize` internally to implement [dimension bindings](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/dimensions). Therefore, I've renamed that internal event to `elementresize`, so the video bindings can bind to the \"regular\" `resize` event. This does change the emit for dimension bindings slightly, since the name of the event is used for the generated handler ([example](https://github.com/MattiasBuelens/svelte/blob/51c1adeca5171d5c1ce2e1ddc78514606214fefa/test/js/samples/bind-width-height/expected.js#L42)).\r\n\r\nFollow-up on #3650.",

Also, ASR aggregate params from all routing levels and push down it and set as props, and these props also often not needed in my component.\r\nIf I remove `export let asr;` I will see a warning in the browser because you will try to set not existent props. But if I keep this export, after #3802 I will see warnings during compile.\r\n\r\n**Idea:**\r\nIf I would have access to a list of export properties I can decide outside component what exactly I can set. Author of ASR @TehShrike also thought about such a feature. \r\nBut this \"interface\" provides much more opportunities. Now, you can request and prepare all data what exactly needs for such a component because you will know the public interface of this component. \r\nProbably it's not needed if you use a component inside another component. \r\nBut looks very helpful for the case when you directly call the constructor.

When `count` is updated reactively in `App`, `updating_count` is still `true` (because it has not been flushed yet), hence setting the final value of `count` back to `RefactoredButton` is skipped.\r\n\r\nThis solution is to move setting `updating_count` (and flush callback) from binding to `p`. The reason is, I believe, *updating in binding* does not entirely represent *updating of a component* i.e. the way parent updates and passes the props to its children is only through `p` and it should also be considered updating.\r\n\r\nI hope my understanding is correct and this change does not create any unexpected behaviours. I have also added a new test case for this.\r\n\r\nThanks and appreciate for your review!\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry, I closed the previous PR when I thought it didn't pass the CI \ud83d\ude13, but I think it's unrelated from my changes \ud83e\udd14.",

For example, `{ readOnly: whatever }` instead of `{ readonly: whatever }`.\r\n- In SSR mode, the corresponding object in the spread array now contains `{ readonly: whatever || null }` instead of `{readonly: whatever }` for boolean attributes, to ensure that the `spread()` function does not serialize falsy attributes.\r\n\r\nBonus SSR bugs I bumped into and fixed while addressing this:\r\n\r\n- `{...{ foo: null }}` was getting serialized as `foo=\"null\"` because `spread()` was checking for strict equality with `undefined`. It's now checking for loose equality with `null`.\r\n- Attributes had to be lowercase for the special logic for `value`, `class`, or any boolean attribute to take effect. These checks are now done case-insensitively.",

It is important to provide two checks, one for the descriptors (or the key itself) and one for the actual `set` property of the descriptor, to prevent throwing errors when trying to access `set` of undefined.\r\n\r\nI also needed to add `//@ts-ignore` when accessing `node.__proto__` since [the TS people don't think valid properties should be on the node interface if they are deprecated](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30587#issuecomment-476780150).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We include all the matching ancestors and then also include the child node.\r\n\r\n`apply_selector` was originally written as a recursive function, but I chose to refactor out part of this into a `block_might_apply_to_node` function so that we're able to compare whether an ancestor node _might_ match a selector block without doing it recursively.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is very much welcome!

For example:\r\n* The `ended` property can be used to show a replay button instead of a regular play/pause button:\r\n```svelte\r\n<button on:click={() => paused = !paused}>\r\n\t{#if ended}\r\n\t\tReplay\r\n\t{:else if paused}\r\n\t\tPlay\r\n\t{:else}\r\n\t\tPause\r\n\t{/if}\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n* The `seeking` property can be used to show a loading spinner while the media element is seeking.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the current compiler would generate code for `bind:volume` like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nm(target, anchor) {\r\n\tinsert(target, audio, anchor);\r\n\r\n\taudio.volume = ctx.volume;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, if `ctx.volume` is still `undefined`, then this would throw a `TypeError` because it's not a number between 0 and 1 ([spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-volume)).\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I've added an `!isNaN(ctx.volume)` check, so we don't set an invalid value when mounting. I've also refactored the code rendering for bindings a bit to make it easier to add such \"mount conditions\", similar to how we add \"update conditions\". \ud83d\ude42",

Creating new code is done with the `CodeBuilder` class and the `deindent` helper, both of which have all sorts of quirks, and manipulating user code is done with `MagicString`, which is also responsible for gluing everything together at the end, using weird, brittle kludges like `[\u2704start-end\u2704]` to preserve source mappings.\r\n\r\nI have a hunch that our lives would be much easier if we were manipulating an AST and stringifying it, and that we'd have new opportunities for code optimisation.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken in this PR is to use a purpose built utility called [code-red](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/code-red) (shitty name, but `codeine` ('pain-free code generation!') and `codify` etc were all taken already. Alternatives welcome) which simplifies the process of generating AST nodes.\r\n\r\nSo far all I've managed to do is get everything to typecheck, it doesn't, like, *do* anything yet.",

In this description I will talk only about part of code from 'walk function' (**walk**) to '**throw new Error(TODO this should not happen!)**'. Sorry for my english.\r\n\r\n## Problem detalization\r\nFirst of all let me illustrate the svelte default work with assignment expression (pic.1)\r\n\r\nPicture 1:\r\n![photo_2019-08-22_04-49-53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12611926/63479920-ac854900-c498-11e9-9ed1-f7f6bec28cc3.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Test \u21160\r\n```\r\nlet foo;\r\nlet bar;\r\nbar = (foo = 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn pic.1 we can see how svelte walk through <script> teg and analysing AST (texts - nodes, arrow - direction, number - walk order). If we look at the code we will see that svelte do all 'significant' action when node **leaving** (remember this). Test \u21160 work normal because pending_assignments array is empty after svelte walk through AST.\r\n\r\nDenote next reductions (more short)\r\n\r\nPicture 2:\r\n![photo_2019-08-22_04-49-50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12611926/63480443-9082a700-c49a-11e9-9df9-a2f312dcc525.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Test \u21161\r\nNow look at the case with error (pic.3)\r\n\r\nPicture 3:\r\n![photo_2019-08-22_04-50-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12611926/63480484-b4de8380-c49a-11e9-9100-e52662c636e6.jpg)\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet foo;\r\nlet bar = (foo = 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn code AE and UpdateExpression have option to add some names in pending stack. In this case AE pushed name 'foo' in stack. Then nodes  actions '**leave**' 19,20,21,22 will not resolve values in stack and we have error.\r\n\r\nWhy like that? look at the source svelte code (code.1) and picture (pic.4) and we will see that **ONLY** Statement-like and AFE nodes have opportunity to refresh entyre pending stack (and they do it always). In Test \u21161 we don't have nodes with permission to refresh stack. As a result we have error.\r\n\r\nCode 1:\r\n```\r\nif (pending_assignments.size > 0) {\r\n\tif (node.type === 'ArrowFunctionExpression') {\r\n\t\tconst insert = Array.from(pending_assignments).map(name => component.invalidate(name)).join('; ');\r\n\t\tpending_assignments = new Set();\r\n\r\n\t\tcode.prependRight(node.body.start, `{ const $$result = `);\r\n\t\tcode.appendLeft(node.body.end, `; ${insert}; return $$result; }`);\r\n\r\n\t\tpending_assignments = new Set();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\telse if (/Statement/.test(node.type)) {\r\n\t\tconst insert = Array.from(pending_assignments).map(name => component.invalidate(name)).join('; ');\r\n\r\n\t\tif (/^(Break|Continue|Return)Statement/.test(node.type)) {\r\n\t\t\tif (node.argument) {\r\n\t\t\t\tcode.overwrite(node.start, node.argument.start, `var $$result = `);\r\n\t\t\t\tcode.appendLeft(node.argument.end, `; ${insert}; return $$result`);\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\tcode.prependRight(node.start, `${insert}; `);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t} else if (parent && /(If|For(In|Of)?|While)Statement/.test(parent.type) && node.type !== 'BlockStatement') {\r\n\t\t\tcode.prependRight(node.start, '{ ');\r\n\t\t\tcode.appendLeft(node.end, `${code.original[node.end - 1] === ';' ? '' : ';'} ${insert}; }`);\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tcode.appendLeft(node.end, `${code.original[node.end - 1] === ';' ? '' : ';'} ${insert};`);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpending_assignments = new Set();\r\n\t} else if (parent && parent.type !== 'ForStatement' && node.type === 'VariableDeclaration') {\r\n\t\tconst insert = Array.from(pending_assignments).map(name => component.invalidate(name)).join('; ');\r\n\r\n\t\tcode.appendLeft(node.end, `${code.original[node.end - 1] === ';' ? '' : ';'} ${insert};`);\r\n\t\tpending_assignments = new Set();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPicture 4:\r\n![photo_2019-08-22_04-49-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12611926/63482888-1f93bd00-c4a3-11e9-8437-22ba9b57d20c.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI propose a solution where we share to VDion 'refresh option' of pending stack(VDtoe i rejected by reason below) and add condition to rare declaration assignment in 'for' cycle .\r\n\r\n### Test 2\r\n\r\nSome time i was spent to find rare cases where refreshing pending stack in VDion will lead to error and i got it. I checked in practice that all nodes from code \u21160 lead to error when you have declaration assignment, except ForStatement. When svelte 'leave' from VDion node then it trying to add $$invalidate for vars (in some cases).  This incorrect semantically (for JS) and lead to error on all platforms. So I decided to add 'check' of current node parent to exclude case where parents it's ForState and decided use VDion (VDtor parent = VDion). \r\n\r\nBut why is it safe? Look at the pic.5 and see that for cycle always have Statements-like nodes like ForStatement and BlockStatement and we have option to process collected names in pending stack when leave from (in this case) 45 or 44. So i don't refresh pending stack in VDion when parent it ForState.\r\n\r\nPicture 5:\r\n![photo_2019-08-22_04-50-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12611926/63481692-ebb69880-c49e-11e9-9f05-abcde5365f21.jpg)\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet foo1;\r\nlet foo2;\r\nfor (let bar = (foo1 = 0); bar < 5; bar += 1) {\r\n  foo1 = foo2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Test 3\r\n\r\nThis issue include case with AE and UpdateExpression. My solution works for both cases and protect stack from overflowing in all main situation, because VDion normally used instead ES (ES refresh stack as user expect). For example pic.6 present case (from related issue) without AE ES and Statement-like nodes.\r\n\r\nThis example shows how VDion refreshed stack that has been pulled in descendants nodes (stack with items emersion from extreme leaves)\r\n\r\nPicture 6:\r\n![photo_2019-08-22_04-50-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12611926/63482213-c4f96180-c4a0-11e9-8e99-5ac59d2cde6d.jpg)\r\n\r\n```\r\n  let eid = 1;\r\n  let foo;\r\n  let employees = [\r\n    {id: eid = (foo = 2), name: 'xxx'},\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n### \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\r\nI resolved the problem by updating leave logic. Now VariableDeclaration always refresh stack and delegate this opportunity in case where ForStatement its parent. I think in future svelte developers must do ast logic more clear. ",

Basically:\r\n\r\nIt accepts multiple classes in a single expression, separated by comma `,`.\r\nHowever, the shorthand syntax only, e.g. `class:active,primary`, **cannot** be used on this case.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Toggle both active and primary classes -->\r\n<div class:active,primary=\"{isActive}\">...</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a small issue on SSR, because it was really coupled and a bit related to the feature.\r\n**If you want me to try split in two PRs, let me know! :)**\r\n\r\nCheck the code below, and the SSR generated on compilation time:\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Simple component example -->\r\n<div\r\n  {...$$props}\r\n  class=\"one\"\r\n  class:two=\"{value === 123}\"\r\n  class:three=\"{value === 123}\"\r\n></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Code generated on SSR\r\n`<div${index.spread([\r\n  $$props,\r\n  {\r\n      class: [`one`, `${value === 123 ? \"three\" : \"\"}`].join(\" \").trim() } // just the last class: expression here\r\n])}${index.add_classes(\r\n  [value === 123 ? \"two\" : \"\", value === 123 ? \"three\" : \"\"].join(\" \").trim() // all class: expressions here\r\n)}></div>`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that on first part of SSR code, it just inject the last `class:` expression, and on `add_classes` function, all `class:` expressions are injected. This generate the issue below:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Expected -->\r\n<div class=\"one two three\"></div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Received on v3.8.1 -->\r\n<div class=\"one three\" class=\"two three\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, with this PR, the code generated on SSR is:\r\n```javascript\r\n`<div${index.spread([\r\n  $$props,\r\n  {\r\n    class: [\r\n      `one`,\r\n      `${(value === 123 ? \"two \" : \"\") + (value === 123 ? \"three \" : \"\")}`\r\n    ]\r\n      .join(\" \")\r\n      .trim()\r\n  }\r\n])}></div>`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe we will need to change a bit yet to generate a clean array of classes, but, for now, I chose the easiest way, only changing a few lines of code.",

I updated the relevant section in the API reference, adding a link to the visualiser and a brief overview of all of the functions exported from that module.\r\n\r\nThe only significant issue is the fact that the 3-panel display makes the preview window quite small on first load. I've worked around this partly by making the visualiser mobile friendly (ish). It isn't friendly to all device sizes and widths but it seems to work fine on desktop and mobile (portrait).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of changes in this PR because I had to update half of the folder names in `content/examples` to get the easing example in the right slot (I put it just after animations).\r\n\r\nCloses #2537.\r\n\r\nEdit: Github is rendering my tabs all weird and I don't know why. I'm pretty sure I'm using the same indentation everywhere, I've even quadruple checked. No clue.",

The change is tiny and speaks for itself :)\r\nFeel free to reject if you don't agree with the arguments below. \r\n\r\nAfter a careful consideration I am suggesting we'd augment the Writable store interface with a get() method.\r\nThe rationale is:\r\n1. All stores implementing Writable<T> are already implementing update, which means there's an easy access to the underlying state (passed to update), so a default implementation could look like:\r\n`function get() { let state;  update(s => state = s); return state; }`\r\n2. There are situations where we need direct state access, but cannot use update (or have to use it in an ugly way like the default implementation above). One situation that comes to mind is writing asynchronous actions: routines outside of any component that need to access the state without a prior subscription, but cannot use update directly, because the new state is produced asynchronously.\r\n3. I am aware I can just use get(store), but it works by creating a subscription and destroying it straight away, which is even uglier than the update workaround in point 1.",

To copy-paste my novella from chat on what happened:\r\n\r\n> Okay so, here's what's going on, but I don't have a good solution to this yet:\r\neslint-plugin-svelte3 needs to `require('svelte/compiler')`. When ESLint is invoked from the command line, this works fine if ESLint, Svelte, and the plugin are all installed in the same level of node_modules (which is what will typically happen when someone is writing an app that uses Svelte).\r\n> When linting the main Svelte repo root, ESLint loads `site/.eslintrc.json`, which attempts to load `eslint-plugin-svelte3`, which fails because apparently it's attempting to resolve `eslint-plugin-svelte3` relative to the root of the project, and not the `site/.eslintrc` file that actually referenced the plugin.\r\n> We can't just move `eslint-plugin-svelte3` up to the top-level `package.json` and `node_modules`, because _it_ needs to be able to `require('svelte/compiler')`.\r\n> I _guess_ one way around this would be to add an option to `eslint-plugin-svelte3`'s settings where you can specify the compiler instance to use. I don't see anything better than this currently.\r\n> This actually does sound acceptable. Being able to specify where the compiler lives would support more esoteric setups, and will also let us lint e.g. `test/**/*.svelte`\r\n\r\nThis PR does let us get linting info on `test/**/*.svelte`. It works by using an updated version of eslint-plugin-svelte3 with a new option where you can specify which Svelte compiler to use.",

I think that's probably the correct behaviour anyway, since no 'update' is happening, and it's useful to be able to 'clear' those kinds of values in `afterUpdate` without triggering another update (which necessitates the infinite loop guard).\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

        "body": "Use verlet-style integration for spring animations. Rather than keeping track of \"value\" and velocity over time, keep track of value and previous-value, and derive velocity from the delta every tick. This has a few benefits, including greater stability (position and velocity can't drift) and simplifying signature of tick_spring (no need to pass velocity back up).\r\n\r\nPulling \"settled\" flag out of the return signature as well means return value is just \"next value\", simplifying code mapping over objects and arrays, and eliminating duplicated code across get_initial_velocity, get_threshold and tick_spring.\r\n\r\nRefactored \"threshold\" calcs, extremely inexpensive to do inline in tick_spring rather than create a parallel structure. Also fixes a rare pathological case where springs will never settle (reading through the code, could happen if velocity was non-zero during a set() where target==current, threshold will be calculated to be zero and settled will always be set to false, leading to infinite animations).\r\n\r\nFunctional changes:\r\n\r\nIn my experience dealing with spring animations, there are a handful of edge-cases where it is nice to have library support. 99% of the time, the only times you'd want to fudge 'stiffness' and 'damping' is during a live interaction (e.g. dragging something around). By providing an idiomatic mechanism hopefully the code around dealing with that could be simpler.\r\n\r\nI propose an additional \"options\" parameter to 'set()' and 'update()'.\r\n\r\nIf passed {hard:true} the set will be considered a \"hard\" set, where you want the value to be set to the target value immediately. This could be extremely useful when implementing dragging for instance.\r\n\r\nIf passed {soft:true} or {soft:[duration]}, the set will be considered a \"soft\" set, where momentum will be preserved for some duration before settling. This could be useful when implementing \"throwing\", e.g. after a drag, on mouseup, 'soft set' to some position and the user's previous momentum will be honored before settling down.\r\n\r\nTechnically momentum preservation happens to a degree now, but aggressive stiffness and/or damping values make it nearly unapparent. This handles the case where you may want more aggressive or heavily underdamped springs but without the apparent velocity discontinuity that happens on throw. (As a real example, in FaceTime, note behavior when tossing around the picture-in-picture, or the iPhone X gestural behavior when tossing apps back to the home screen).\r\n\r\nInternally this is implemented by temporarily setting mass to infinity and ramping back to normal over some duration.\r\n\r\n\"Hard sets\" are also special-cased to trigger a same-frame set and fulfilment, leading to more responsive dragging. Best case is a one frame improvement in drag latency (noticed in Safari). This also handles the \"old way\" method of munging 'stiffness' and 'damping' to 1, so the improvement applies to existing code.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for creating a pull request.

Fortunately the required change is small.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I am not entirely sure how to test this change. The goal here is to make sure that whenever you would normally teardown your store subscriptions, it is also tearing down these RxJS-shaped subscriptions. This is most commonly something you want in a component scenario. Say you have a timer component in your app that you show and remove with an `{#if}` block, when the `{#if}` block hides the component, you'd want to tear down the underlying Observable that is \"ticking\".\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting: I _totally_ understand if this sort of change isn't palatable. It's mostly my concern that RxJS users excited about Svelte will make mistakes that are really nasty to debug. If two lines of code solves that, then I had to try. :smile: \r\n\r\nRelated #2549\r\n",

Then you will enter that project's name inside the Makefile. I don't think this is particularly sensitive, but you can inject it thru your CD pipeline, whatever it is.\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to update the DNS for `svelte.dev` via Cloudflare and setup the CloudRun \"domain mapping\".\r\n\r\nFinally, this does nothing with ENV values. I haven't followed the trail much, but **personally** I have them live on the platform itself. CloudRun (as with many other services) allow you to configure ENV values on the service itself, which makes them available to the running container. This basically means that you can configure them once (inside GCP's GUI if you want) and then never have to touch them again, even between deployments.\r\n\r\nI can help you with any of these steps if you want. Happy to help.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI didn't remove the `now.json` file in case it was still needed for reference?",

Either we stick with Overpass **or** Roboto, but if, then please overall. Using both irritates the eye IMO.\r\nFont-load is expensive 3 x ~20kb.\r\n- everything we need for p, ol, ul except margin is done in body\r\nIs that bad practice?\r\n- semibold is **bold enough**\r\n  IMO no need for a font-weight:700 which is a bit too fat, clumsy and not adequate to lightweight-svelte\r\n- Headlines are much bigger than normal text per se. That alone is enough to emphasise. I suggest to go with font-weight:600.\r\nbolder doesn't mean \"more important\"\r\n  In addition we're able to emphasise the lines even more using color, which I did here.\r\n\r\n##### thin-font is not needed\r\n\r\n- I suggest we go with a svg-version of the logotype (see static-folder)\r\n- more precise control over letter-spacing i.e. letters \"...LTE\"\r\n- consistent proportions, styling and weights where appended\r\n- better handling outside of svelte.universe\r\n  submit the svg, no missing fonts\r\n\r\n##### negative space* is our friend\r\n\r\n- added more side-padding to mobile view\r\n- added more padding to sidebars (tutorial, docs) \r\n\r\ndoesn't look so crushed and makes a more generous impression.\r\n\r\n###### * In previous posts I always used the term \"whitespace\" when I meant \"negative space\" which is due to my lack of translating to correct en. \r\n\r\n##### homepage\r\n\r\n- added some more logo-svgs (logotype, combined logo-logotype)\r\n- removed rounded boxes-outlines from \"Who's using\"\r\ntoo much IMO\r\n- my personal taste: I don't like the logo with dimmed primary-color (forgive me)\r\n- unfortunately I was unable to figure out what IntersectionObserver is doing with the examples on mobile-screen\r\n- I've texted a bit.

        "body": "Ref #2241.\r\n\r\nNot sure if these are ready to be promoted to built-in functions yet. I'm encountering occasional hard-to-reproduce positioning bugs, and `crossfade` doesn't handle changes in size (but maybe that's ok given its intended use? I think we *can* accommodate size changes, it just involves `style.transformOrigin` and some arithmetic).\r\n\r\nAlso, if you look really closely the `crossfade` opacity isn't quite right \u2014 since one side goes from 0 to 1 and the other goes from 1 to 0, in the middle they're both 0.5 which results in a total opacity of 0.75, when you really want the total opacity to stay at 1 throughout. Unfortunately the only way to achieve that is to use [this blending formula](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/ramjet/blob/master/src/interpolators/opacity.js) which requires that you know which element is on top, which you could *maybe* do with `getElementsFromPoint` but otherwise you have to figure out stacking order using something like https://gitlab.com/Rich-Harris/stacking-order. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, these effects are difficult to achieve by hand, so maybe we should include these functions and treat any updates as bugfixes so as not to anger the semver gods? At the very least I think we have the right API now:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [send, receive] = crossfade({\r\n  // can supply default parameters\r\n  easing: elasticOut,\r\n\r\n  // duration can be a number or a function based on distance to travel\r\n  duration: distance => Math.sqrt(distance) * 50,\r\n  \r\n  fallback: (node, params, intro) => {\r\n    // can return different transitions based on `intro`, if desired.\r\n    // structuring `params` for fallback transitions is easily\r\n    // done in whatever way the user sees fit\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```",

I'm not positive this is a good idea, but it's definitely a better idea than requiring a `.get()` as part of the store contract or blessing such a method by having it be part of the default `readable` and `writable` stores.",

To start, only mustaches and attributes will check their dependencies for mutations and skip the update code if they don't look like they change.\r\n\r\nThis does _not_ attempt the stretch goal of hoisting non-mutating refs up out of the contextual chunk of the component because my initial naive attempt blew up the world. It turns out it's not as simple as just adjusting the hoist for `const`s to include `let`s and moving it to after the template is processed :smile:.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a check on the dependency tracking for expressions that will skip the `const` check if the reference happens to include more than the base member (or at least I think it does, I'm still a little fuzzy on how scoping and references are handled, but I'm getting there).\r\n\r\nThere's already a TODO regarding how many times the js is walked, and this adds yet another pass through that could probably be combined with at least one of the others. It may make sense to have all the walking methods return an object of listeners for a walk with closures set up for their internal state and then run a single walk at the end that fires said closures as it goes.

        "body": "This adds a little step to slot rendering that makes event handlers render inside a conditional for the slot default content, which fixes #1977, but...\r\n\r\nThere's an issue with code builder that causes some weird end of block `}`s to get misplaced with stacked `addConditional` and `pushCondition`s, generating invalid code in the destroy handler. I got a little lost trying to track the stringy handling in the code builder, so I wimpled out and rewrote it as a tree of collected statements that handle stringification in the `toString` method. This may totally not be a direction anybody wants to take, but it simplified the management of statements quite a bit. The stringification is a little complex, but it is all bundled together in one relatively readable chunk.\r\n\r\nIf it's a reasonable approach, this could also open up a path for dropping some redundant `if` blocks. For instance, `addConditional` could get another param that allowed reusing an existing `if` block for statements that aren't order-sensitive, so things like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\t\td(detach) {\r\n\t\t\tif (detach) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdetachNode(div);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block0) if_block0.d();\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block1) if_block1.d();\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block2) if_block2.d();\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block3) if_block3.d();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (detach) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdetachNode(text7);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block4) if_block4.d(detach);\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tif (detach) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdetachNode(if_block4_anchor);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould become\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\t\td(detach) {\r\n\t\t\tif (detach) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdetachNode(div);\r\n\t\t\t\tdetachNode(text7);\r\n\t\t\t\tdetachNode(if_block4_anchor);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block0) if_block0.d();\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block1) if_block1.d();\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block2) if_block2.d();\r\n\t\t\tif (if_block3) if_block3.d();\r\n\t\t}\r\n```",

        "body": "Just some test output for now \u2014 manually tweaked all the `expected.js` files to help me think about the problem a bit more. Couple of takeaways:\r\n\r\n* I was wrong about being able to represent up to 53 values in a bitmask. JS bitwise operators work in 32 bits, which means we can represent up to 31 values. I don't know if that's a dealbreaker\r\n* If a component only has one reactive value (where 'reactive' means 'referenced in the template or in a reactive declaration'), there's no need for *any* change tracking \u2014 if `changed === 0` then we can skip updates altogether, which means that if an update *is* happening then that single reactive value definitely has changed\r\n* Since `changed` is therefore an optional argument to `update` functions, the order of arguments should be reversed \u2014 `(ctx, changed) => {...}` rather than `(changed, ctx) => {...}` \u2014 so that we can omit it where possible.\r\n* `n & -1` is only `0` when `n === 0` (in fact, for integers up to a certain size, `n & -1 === n`). This gives us an easy way to say 'everything changed,' e.g. when initialising reactive declarations\r\n\r\nWe might be able to use that insight to reduce duplication between create and update code. If you have a template [like this](https://v3.svelte.technology/repl?version=3.0.0-alpha15&gist=cc1fa26b91ba15a791525c49728b26c9)...\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<h1>Hello {name.split('').reverse().reverse().join('').toUpperCase()}!</h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\n...that expression is output twice:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction create_fragment($$, ctx) {\r\n  var h1, text0, text1_value = ctx.name.split('').reverse().reverse().join('').toUpperCase(), text1, text2, current;\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    c() {\r\n      h1 = createElement(\"h1\");\r\n      text0 = createText(\"Hello \");\r\n      text1 = createText(text1_value);\r\n      text2 = createText(\"!\");\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    p(changed, ctx) {\r\n      if ((changed.name) && text1_value !== (text1_value = ctx.name.split('').reverse().reverse().join('').toUpperCase())) {\r\n        setData(text1, text1_value);\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsually we're not duplicating code as contrived as that, but it's a problem nonetheless. A neater version would look like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nfunction create_fragment($$, ctx) {\r\n-  var h1, text0, text1_value = ctx.name.split('').reverse().reverse().join('').toUpperCase(), text1, text2, current;\r\n+  var h1, text0, text1, text1_value, text2, current;\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    c() {\r\n      h1 = createElement(\"h1\");\r\n      text0 = createText(\"Hello \");\r\n-     text1 = createText(text1_value);\r\n+     text1 = createText();\r\n      text2 = createText(\"!\");\r\n+     this.p(ctx, -1);\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n-    p(changed, ctx) {\r\n+    p(ctx, changed) {\r\n-      if ((changed.name) && text1_value !== (text1_value = ctx.name.split('').reverse().reverse().join('').toUpperCase())) {\r\n+      if (changed & /*name*/1 && text1_value !== (text1_value = ctx.name.split('').reverse().reverse().join('').toUpperCase())) {\r\n        setData(text1, text1_value);\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had a run that problem a while back but it proved too difficult, particularly around instantiating nested components. It might be easier now.\r\n\r\nAlso, at present, the `$$dirty` object passed into the reactive declaration update block (which is the same as `changed` elsewhere; we should make that consistent) is conveniently mutable, which means that [sequential updates work](https://v3.svelte.technology/repl?version=3.0.0-alpha15&gist=3ea7951bdff4c875d89d2dcdcd660e7f):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n  export let a = 1;\r\n  let b, c, d;\r\n\t\r\n  $: b = a + 1;\r\n  $: c = b + 1;\r\n  $: d = c + 1;\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// becomes...\r\n$$self.$$.update = ($$dirty = { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 }) => {\r\n  if ($$dirty.a) {\r\n    b = a + 1; $$invalidate('b', b);\r\n  }\r\n  if ($$dirty.b) {\r\n    c = b + 1; $$invalidate('c', c);\r\n  }\r\n  if ($$dirty.c) {\r\n    d = c + 1; $$invalidate('d', d);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `$$dirty.b` is true because of the `$$invalidate('b', b)` right before it. If `$$dirty` isn't an object that would no longer work. So I guess we'd need to do this instead:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-$$self.$$.update = ($$dirty = { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 }) => {\r\n+$$self.$$.update = ($$dirty = -1) => {\r\n-  if ($$dirty.a) {\r\n-    b = a + 1; $$invalidate('b', b);\r\n+  if ($$dirty & /*a*/1) {\r\n+    b = a + 1; $$invalidate('b', 1, b); $$dirty |= 2;\r\n  }\r\n-  if ($$dirty.b) {\r\n-    c = b + 1; $$invalidate('c', c);\r\n+  if ($$dirty & /*b*/2) {\r\n+    c = b + 1; $$invalidate('c', 2, c); $$dirty |= 4;\r\n  }\r\n-  if ($$dirty.c) {\r\n-    d = c + 1; $$invalidate('d', d);\r\n+  if ($$dirty & /*c*/4) {\r\n+    d = c + 1; $$invalidate('d', 3, d); $$dirty |= 8;\r\n  }\r\n+  return $$dirty;\r\n};\r\n```",

These functions return a `writable` store, except that `store.set` and `store.update` change to their target value gradually, and return a Promise.\r\n\r\n## `tweened`\r\n\r\nThe API for `tweened` looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { tweened } from 'svelte/motion';\r\nimport { elasticOut } from 'svelte/easing';\r\n\r\nconst coords = tweened({ x: 0, y: 0 }, {\r\n  // these are default options that will be used\r\n  // if none are provided for a given tween\r\n  duration: 800,\r\n  easing: elasticOut\r\n});\r\n\r\nwindow.addEventListener('click', e => {\r\n  coords.set({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY }, {\r\n    // these will optionally override\r\n    // individual default options\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's also `coords.update`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncoords.update((target_value, actual_value) => {\r\n  x: target_value.x + 100,\r\n  y: target_value.y\r\n}, opts);\r\n```\r\n\r\nComplete set of options:\r\n\r\n* `delay` \u2014 how long in milliseconds before the value should start changing. Any previous tweens won't be cancelled until the new one starts. Defaults to `0`\r\n* `duration` \u2014 how long it should take, in milliseconds. Defaults to `400`. Alternatively, pass a function that receives `current_value` and `target_value` arguments (useful if you want larger tweens to take longer, for example)\r\n* `easing` \u2014 an easing function, e.g. from `svelte/easing`\r\n* `interpolate` \u2014 a custom `(current_value, target_value) => t => value` function. Svelte tweens numbers, dates, and arrays or objects containing numbers or dates (however deeply nested) as long as everything is the same 'shape' \u2014 so it will tween `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` to `{ x: 100, y: 100 }` for example. But it won't tween things like colour strings, matrix strings etc without a custom interpolator.\r\n\r\n\r\n## `spring`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { spring } from 'svelte/motion';\r\n\r\nconst coords = spring({ x: 0, y: 0 }, {\r\n  // these are default options that will be used\r\n  // if none are provided for a given tween\r\n  stiffness: 0.1,\r\n  damping: 0.5\r\n});\r\n\r\nwindow.addEventListener('click', e => {\r\n  coords.set({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n`spring` gives you less direct control, but can result in more pleasing motion depending on what you're trying to do. There are two options, `stiffness` and `damping`, that control the spring's physics \u2014 both are values between 0 and 1. You can change these values after the fact with e.g. `spring.stiffness = 0.5`.\r\n\r\nCustom interpolators aren't supported, because they don't really make much sense here. You can interpolate the values that `tweened` supports out of the box.\r\n\r\n## Coordination\r\n\r\nThere's some central coordination that runs all current tasks on `requestAnimationFrame` (but only when `tasks.size > 0`) and handles promise resolution etc. It may make sense to use this for element transitions and animations as well. We might even want to expose it to userland \u2014 the API is fairly simple:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { abort, promise } = add_task(() => {\r\n  // this will run on the next animation frame, and\r\n  // on every frame after that until it returns a\r\n  // falsy value, at which point the promise fulfils\r\n});\r\n\r\npromise.then(() => {\r\n  // the task is complete\r\n});\r\n\r\n// stop calling the function. the promise will\r\n// never resolve, if it didn't already:\r\nabort();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThings to consider:\r\n\r\n* For testability, we might want to expose hooks that make it easy to advance to the next frame (or an arbitrary future frame). At the moment this is done for transitions in the test suite somewhat hackily (search for `raf.tick`)\r\n* Similarly, it would be neat if we could control time globally across a Svelte app, the way Edward Faulkner does in [this talk](https://youtu.be/4JofVQ3nGrw?t=1267). Really helpful for debugging animations\r\n* `requestAnimationFrame` is fine most of the time, but on many VR displays (e.g. you're using Svelte with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) you need a faster refresh rate than 60Hz, and should use [vrDisplayInstance.requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRDisplay/requestAnimationFrame) instead. It'd nice if there was an easy way to do this (or if it was even taken care of for us?)",

This means that the existing `Component` class has been renamed to `InlineComponent`.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `src/index.ts` file has been radically simplified by moving things into the folders where they belong.

With `containedTransitions` the transitions are only run when the closest non-component block (e.g. an if-block or each-block) changes state. This means the transitions on the items of an each-block will not run when the each-block first appears on screen, or when it is removed, but they will run when items are added/removed from the each block. In addition, if a whole page fades in with a transition at the page level, the there will not be other transitions occuring inside the page.\r\n\r\nThe transition containers do not include components, since a component is a reusable container and not a state-driven block. Thus, a transition at the root of a component will run when that component is added to the DOM inside an if-block or each-block the same way an element with a transition inside either of those blocks is run.",

(Granted, after zipping the difference is almost zilch \u2014 34141 from 34145 \u2014 but that's after concatenating all the code-split chunks, and in any case minimising the JS that needs to be parsed and eval'd is the larger goal.)\r\n\r\nCompiling a standalone `<h1>hello {name}</h1>` component goes up from 2,391 to 2,469 bytes, a 3.3% increase. That's a more 'visible' increase for someone evaluating Svelte for the first time, but maybe that's ok?",

        "body": "1.58.0 introduced a new list diffing algorithm, intended to solve the performance problems in #588. The original PR (#1249) was incredibly fast, but unfortunately had incorrect behaviour in some cases (where sequences of blocks were moving together). I modified the algorithm, thinking I was fixing the bug, but in fact I was also undoing the reason it was so fast, and everything actually became *slower* than it was before.\r\n\r\nOops.\r\n\r\nI first tried to implement the classic list diffing algorithm described in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@localvoid/how-to-win-in-web-framework-benchmarks-8bc31af76ce7) but... it's too complicated for my liberal arts major brain. I had a hunch that there might be a simpler approach with the same performance characteristics, that would avoid ping-ponging from the front to the back of the list. And here it is, in pseudo-code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet o = length of old_list\r\nlet n = length of new_list\r\n\r\nlet deltas = Map<key, delta> where key is present in both lists,\r\n                             and delta is abs(change in key position)\r\n\r\nlet did_move = Map<key, boolean>\r\nlet will_move = Map<key, boolean>\r\n\r\nlet insertion_point = null (i.e. the end)\r\n\r\nwhile (o > 0 and n > 0)\r\n  let old_key = old_list[o - 1];\r\n  let new_key = new_list[n - 1];\r\n\r\n  if (old_key === new_key)\r\n    o--\r\n    n--\r\n    insertion_point = new_key\r\n\r\n  else if (old_key is not in new_list)\r\n    remove(old_key)\r\n    o--\r\n\r\n  else if (new_key is not in old_list)\r\n    insert(new_key, insertion_point)\r\n    n--\r\n\r\n  else\r\n    if (did_move[old_key])\r\n      o--\r\n\r\n    else if (will_move[new_key])\r\n      insert(new_key, insertion_point)\r\n      insertion_point = new_key\r\n      n--\r\n\r\n    else if (deltas[new_key] > deltas[old_key])\r\n      did_move[new_key] = true\r\n      insert(new_key, insertion_point)\r\n      insertion_point = new_key\r\n      n--\r\n\r\n    else\r\n      will_move[old_key] = true\r\n      o--\r\n\r\nwhile (o-- > 0)\r\n  let old_key = old_list[o]\r\n  remove(old_key)\r\n\r\nwhile (n-- > 0)\r\n  let new_key = new_list[n]\r\n  insert(new_key, insertion_point)\r\n  insertion_point = new_key\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's likely that this isn't novel at all, and it's possible that it has negative performance characteristics in circumstances I haven't considered. But it seems to work pretty well.\r\n\r\nThe secret sauce is `deltas`. When changing `ABCDE` to `EABCD` and working backwards (which is slightly more convenient), there are two possibilities...\r\n\r\n* move D to the end, then C (which is now in front of the E) in front of the D, B in front of the C, A in front of the B, or\r\n* move the E to the front\r\n\r\n...one of which is obviously better \u2014 the second is one move, the first is four moves. But if you codify the rule that on encountering different keys you should always move the *old* key rather than the *new* key, then going from `ABCDE` to `BCDEA` would take four moves instead of one.\r\n\r\n`deltas` allows us to make the right decision in both cases. In the first example, E would have to move four spaces to get to its new home, whereas D would only have to move one. In other words, moving the old key (E) is 'worth' four moves. In the second example, E would only have to move one space, whereas A would have to move four \u2014 so we move the new key (A), not the old key (E). \r\n\r\nIn the row swapping case that motivated all this work (the [js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/)) test, this algorithm is as fast as #1249, but also works for those tricky edge cases.\r\n\r\nWould be grateful if anyone out there who is more knowledgable about these sorts of things can sanity check me though...\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n* [x] tidy things up a little bit\r\n* [x] double check all the benchmarks this time\r\n* [x] remove all the linked list stuff, which is no longer necessary (store the array of keys instead)",

That's why the lifecycle-events-test got a nested component.\r\n\r\n(Maybe ondestroy could simply fire before detachment?)\r\n\r\nIt seemed easiest to just add an onunmount-hook.

If we want to support non-top-level `<script>` and `<style>` (which don't get special handling from Svelte) we're still going to have to parse them differently, since they're not HTML. Perhaps these should get their own `Node` subclass? That might not actually make anything tidier.\r\n\r\nThere's also a possibility that it would be valuable to allow for `{{tags}}` in these `<script>` and `<style>` elements. (In this branch right now their contents are always parsed as a single string until the closing tag.) That would quite possibly be very confusing and have to come with a lot of caveats, especially in DOM mode.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, the first commit here (`in stringified Text nodes, only escape &, <, >`) is the only one I feel particularly good about. There aren't even tests yet.\r\n\r\ntl;dr I still really don't know what a solution to #1082 would look like.",

The main motivation is easier testing with a fake service, secondary motivation is to make the chat be less dependent on a particular vendor.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst service = new VendorService() // handles http/ws communication, the chat is not tied to a particular backend, it'll work for any as long as this service has right methods/events\r\n\r\nnew Chat({\r\n   target: document.getElementById('foo'),\r\n   data: { brand: 'Bar Baz' },\r\n   service\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe chat component itself looks like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{{#if closed}}\r\n<Bar on:click='toggle(OPEN)'>Leave a message</Bar>\r\n{{/if}}\r\n\r\n{{#if open}}\r\n<Widget on:click='toggle(CLOSE)'/>\r\n{{/if}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen inside of the Widget I use the service e.g. to send a message, receive messages etc.:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport default {\r\n  oncreate () {\r\n    this.service = this._root.options.service\r\n  },\r\n  methods () {\r\n    send (event) {\r\n      // set data etc.\r\n      this.service.emit('send:message', message.text)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nother approaches I though of or that were suggested to solve this:\r\n\r\na) propagate events from lowest components (e.g. form submits) and handle all of it outside of the chat component - I didn't like it because I'd need to propagate it via many layers, too much hassle, too close to redux kind of way which I find very verbose\r\n\r\nb) check if `service` can be passed like the `store`, so that it can be automatically injected into components below - based on discussion in gitter I understood that it seems that dependency injection was discussed before and it's seen as a fragile pattern (I have the same feeling based on what I saw in other libraries, however I also think that it's not necessarily the pattern that is wrong but the excessive use, any pattern is wrong when overused)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnew Chat({\r\n  target: document.getElementById('foo'),\r\n  store,\r\n  includes: { service }\r\n})\r\n```\r\nthen the line:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nthis.service = this.root.options.service\r\n```\r\n\r\nis unnecessary.\r\n\r\nc) pass it via `store` as `store.service`. A little bit weird, unexpected\r\n\r\nd) pass it via `data`. Weird as well, unexpected\r\n\r\nI do understand the desire to keep svelte as concise as possible so I'm open to all suggestions :) Thanks a lot.",

But here comes the fun part \u2014 all children of `<App>` get `this.store`, and if you opt in with the `store: true` compiler option then they become bound to it.\r\n\r\nOnce bound, components can reference store properties by prefixing them with `$`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<h1>Hello {{$name}}!</h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\nStore props and regular props coexist peacefully. For example a component's computed property can happily depend on both store and regular props.\r\n\r\nBecause this is Svelte, components only watch properties that they depend on, so there's no penalty for storing and updating everything centrally. The footprint is tiny (we can reuse component prototype methods, so the whole thing is less than 100 lines), and if you know how to use Svelte you already know how to use `Store`. And of course it's completely opt-in (we have to add `component.store = component._root.options.store` to the `init` function shared between components, but that's the only penalty for people *not* using `Store`).\r\n\r\nI'm excited about this addition. Let me know what you all think.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n* [x] More tests\r\n* [x] Implement `bind:foo=$bar`\r\n* [x] Implement `on:click='store.doSomething()'` (i.e. whitelist `store.*`)\r\n",

        "body": "Chapter 94 of the unending quest to minimise bundle size. I noticed while looking at the minified output of a @TehShrike project that a lot of variable names end up being two characters rather than just one. That's because a) a typical Svelte component declares several variables/functions (the constructor itself, any fragment functions, local CSS encapsulation helper, etc), and b) Rollup and webpack combine all the top-level variables and functions into a shared scope (known as scope hoisting).\r\n\r\nIn theory, scope hoisting makes minification easier, because module A can refer to module B's exports directly, rather than as (unmangleable) properties of a module object. In practice, however, it can mean that you have so many top-level variables that Uglify runs out of single-character names, and has to use two-character names.\r\n\r\nWrapping the generated module in an IIFE means there's only one top-level declaration. Empirically, this results in slightly smaller minified code (which means lower parse costs). Unminified code ends up slightly more readable, because Rollup doesn't keep renaming functions to avoid conflicts (`create_main_fragment`, `create_main_fragment$1`, `create_main_fragment$2` etc). Those benefits ought to increase further if we move things out of the `template` object and remove the IIFE that surrounds it, per #756.\r\n\r\nGzipped code is actually very slightly *larger*, however, with the code I've tried so far. Not sure how much weight to place on this, since gzip is such a mysterious beast. So it probably warrants a bit more testing before we decide if this is a desirable change.",

        "body": "This is far, far, far from done, but I thought I may as well put it up here and try to articulate the approach I'm taking.\r\n\r\nEssentially, each block gets ~~two~~ three new methods \u2014 `create`, `claim` and `hydrate`. `create` contains most of the stuff that previously went at the top of the block, while `claim` contains basically the same code but 'claiming' chunks of existing DOM rather than creating new stuff:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction create_main_fragment ( state, component ) {\r\n  var h1, text;\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    create: function () {\r\n      h1 = createElement( 'h1' );\r\n      text = createText( \"Hello world!\" );\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    claim: function ( nodes ) {\r\n      h1 = claimElement( nodes, 'H1' );\r\n      var h1_nodes = children( h1 )\r\n\r\n      text = claimText( h1_nodes, \"Hello world!\" );\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    mount: function ( target, anchor ) {\r\n      insertNode( h1, target, anchor );\r\n      appendNode( text, h1 );\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    unmount: function () {\r\n      detachNode( h1 );\r\n      detachNode( h1 );\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    destroy: noop\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `hydrate` method (if necessary) adds attributes, event listeners and so on.\r\n\r\nThere are three new helper functions referenced here \u2014 `children`, `claimElement` and `claimText`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function children ( element ) {\r\n  return Array.from(element.childNodes);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function claimElement ( nodes, name ) {\r\n  for (var i = 0; i < nodes.length; i += 1) {\r\n    var node = nodes[i];\r\n    if (node.nodeName === name) {\r\n      return nodes.splice(i, 1)[0]; // TODO strip unwanted attributes\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return createElement(name);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function claimText ( nodes, data ) {\r\n  for (var i = 0; i < nodes.length; i += 1) {\r\n    var node = nodes[i];\r\n    if (node.nodeType === 3) {\r\n      node.data = data;\r\n      return nodes.splice(i, 1)[0];\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return createText(data);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we begin as before, calling `create_main_fragment`, but then we `hydrate` it with the array of nodes that comprise the children of `options.target`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthis._fragment = create_main_fragment( this._state, this );\r\nthis._fragment.hydrate( children( options.target ) );\r\nthis._fragment.mount( options.target, null );\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that we're not diffing in the conventional sense \u2014 we're simply grabbing the first node that seems like it might be the right one. This *ought* to handle most cases (DOM is empty, DOM is already in exactly the right state, DOM needs minor repairs, whether that means adding or removing nodes) pretty well, and only have negative performance implications in pathological situations that are easily avoided.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n* [x] Removing excess DOM at the end of the process\r\n* [x] Removing unwanted attributes from elements\r\n* [x] each blocks (keyed and unkeyed)\r\n* [x] raw tags\r\n* [x] components\r\n* [x] making this opt-in (i.e. skipping `hydrate` methods and associated helpers unless, say, the component is compiled with `options.hydratable === true`)\r\n* [x] things I haven't thought of yet",

If `cascade` is false, and a component has a `<style>` attribute, *all* elements get the `svelte-123xyz` attribute (not just the component's top-level elements), and selectors are transformed in such a way that they only apply to the component's own elements, *not* to child components.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be more in line with the wider community's expectations of how CSS scoping should work, and makes it easier to do certain forms of analysis such as identifying redundant selectors, and omitting the `svelte-123xyz` attribute on nodes that won't benefit from it. I'm therefore proposing that we remove the option in v2 and *never* cascade styles, unless selectors have been wrapped with the `:global(...)` escape hatch (which is the convention used by css-modules and styled-jsx).\r\n\r\nKeyframes are a little tricky \u2014 this...\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@keyframes :global(my-animation) {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...isn't valid CSS, so it causes problems with syntax highlighting and linting in editors, and with parsing during compilation. For that reason, this PR **does not** use `:global(...)` for animation names as css-modules does. Instead, animation names can be marked as global with the `-global-` prefix (which is simply removed during transformation):\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@keyframes -global-my-animation {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think?",

In the case of #592, where a `yield` block exists inside an `if` block, we want to unmount the yield fragment when the `if` condition becomes falsy, *not* destroy it.\r\n\r\nThis PR separates the two things, so that blocks have `unmount` and `destroy` methods. `fragment.destroy` therefore no longer takes a `detach` argument that determines whether or not to unmount.\r\n\r\nGenerated code size has increased slightly as a result of this change, but as a follow-up we can determine during the preprocess step whether or not a given block needs a `destroy` method (i.e. does it contain event handlers, components etc, or does `unmount` take care of cleanup?) and omit it if possible, the same way we do with `update` methods.",

I see some other unit tests involving `<select>` have been disabled, apparently because of limitations or bugs in jsdom.\r\n\r\nThe specific test cases ([REPL](https://svelte.technology/repl?version=1.17.2&gist=eb693d0f85a05e17500fcce2a5aea647), [REPL](https://svelte.technology/repl?version=1.17.2&gist=5ec3e1ac9df113d4719fdfe3854b75da)) seem to work with this change when they're compiled and manipulated manually - and no other unit tests break.\r\n\r\nThe idea in the PR is to move _all_ of the attribute handling of `<select>` elements (attaching event handlers, etc) after the code for handling its children - but within that code generated by visiting the attributes to keep everything in the same relative order as it is for other types of elements. I can't see what any unpleasant side-effects of this might be, but there could still be some. As a bonus, the generation code in `Element.js` is slightly tidier.\r\n\r\ncc @saibotsivad @TehShrike ",

In situations where an if-block or each-block is immediately followed by a DOM node (element, text, or [raw] mustache tag), there's no need to create a comment just to anchor the block to the right location in the DOM; we can just use the following element. The same is true if the block is the last thing inside an element.\r\n\r\nNow that we're doing two passes over the markup AST this is *reasonably* straightforward \u2014 we just need to give each DOM node a name in advance, so that on the second pass an if-block or each-block can easily determine whether or not it needs to create a comment node.",

We're currently making two such aliasers, one that is used for helpers and other top-level scope stuff as before, and the other that is used for getUniqueName which handles lower-scope stuff.\r\n\r\nThese changes look to be able to cope with a three-way conflict between the `template` top-level variable, a `template` import, and the `template` variable created if you have a component called `Template`.

Unfortunately my original test case failed to test child components (although my version did work for them) and their css was not being added to the correct document.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when a child component is mounted, the target element is not yet part of the correct document. It was created using document.createElement, thus `target.ownerDocument` points to the original document (`window.document`). After `mount`, the target element is added to the iframe and `target.ownerDocument` is pointing to the iframe's `document`.\r\n\r\n I can think of three options for fixing this:\r\n1. store the root components `options.target.ownerDocument` and reference it in the child components (my original approach)\r\n2. create elements using the correct document (using `target.ownerDocument.createElement`)\r\n3. call addCss **after** the elements are added to the DOM\r\n\r\nI tried the last by adding a setTimeout around the addCss call:\r\n```generator.current.builders.mount.addLine( `setTimeout(function(){\tif ( !target.ownerDocument.__sveltecss_${parsed.hash} ) addCss( target.ownerDocument )});` );```\r\n\r\nIt works, but it's hardly ideal. First of all, it breaks all css tests due to it's async nature. Even worse, it triggers multiple style updates and reflows, since every component's css is added independently, instead of all in one go.\r\n\r\nSo I tried different stuff and finally came up with this solution: add the css after the dom is updated, using a render hook.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am fully aware that this is a niche use case, so if the changes have an impact on the overall performance, I am ok with maintaining my own fork with this patch.",

Things that need to happen for all compilers (gathering imports, figuring out whether we have computed properties, contextualising expressions, dealing with sourcemaps, etc) are built-in to the generator. Stuff that is specific to a compiler like `createMountStatement` gets removed from the generator, and is instead handled as events (i.e. a visitor can do `generator.fire('createMountStatement, {...})`, and the compiler can have a corresponding event listener).",

        "body": "This is a slightly bigger PR than just adding SSR, because we need to shuffle some files around. But the tl;dr is that you can now render Svelte components in Node.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrequire( 'svelte/ssr/register' );\r\n\r\nvar thing = require( './components/Thing.html' );\r\nvar html = thing.render({ foo: 'bar', baz: 42 });\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that components *don't* have the same API that they do in the browser, because they're doing a different job. Rather than being stateful, you call the `render` method anew each time you want to generate HTML.\r\n\r\nYou can use default `data`, `helpers`, `computed` properties, nested `components` and so on. The lifecycle hooks (`onrender` and `onteardown`) are **not** called.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nJust like the main Svelte compiler, the SSR compiler generates code specific to the component \u2013 though in this case, it has a much easier job which is to concatenate strings together.\r\n\r\nUsing `require.extensions` makes it nice and easy for nested components to work, without the app developer having to mess around adding resolver hooks and whatnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Things to be aware of\r\n\r\n* `<style>` tags are not currently supported. Coming soon. One of the things I'd like to do is make it possible to extract encapsulated styles from a component tree so that it can be rendered to a single CSS block, either as a standalone `.css` file or as inline styles. There's a couple of pieces that need to be moved into place first though\r\n* If you have any other `require.extensions` hooks that intercept `.html` files, this will probably not end well. We'll figure out a way to handle that eventually, but for now I expect that's an imaginary problem\r\n* `import` declarations are transpiled to the equivalent `require` statements, meaning your components' dependencies will need to be Node-friendly otherwise your app will blow up. (If you're using browser-specific stuff inside methods or lifecycle hooks, that's fine \u2013 just as long as the mere *presence* of those dependencies doesn't break Node when they load. In most situations, you'll probably be fine.)\r\n* The flip side of SSR is client-side 'hydration', i.e. reusing elements rather than creating new ones. That's not yet implemented \u2013 we need to evaluate our options. Replacing server-rendered DOM with client-rendered DOM isn't the worst thing in the world though.\r\n* This is not yet battle-tested! Bug reports to the usual place...",
