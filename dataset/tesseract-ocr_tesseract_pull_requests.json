        "body": "Written in collaboration with Aram (see commit author).\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds support to output `ocr_photo` elements in the hOCR renderer. `ocr_photo` is \"Something that requires JPEG or PNG to be represented well\" per the specification. `ocr_image` would be for SVG content. Since that is hard to distinguish, let's just go to `ocr_photo` unconditionally.\r\n\r\nThere are a few open questions/concerns that I can think of:\r\n\r\n1. Do we want to render `ocrx_word` elements inside `ocr_photo`? I think per the hOCR specification this is allowed, but Tesseract seems to just \"find\" a word of the same bounding box with nothing but spaces as characters, in our testing.\r\n2. If we do *not* want to have words inside `ocr_photo` elements, should we skip generating the `ocr_line` when writing hOCR even if the hocr images option is turned off, since we know the element is detected as an image block type with (apparently) no actual content?\r\n2. If we want to skip adding `ocrx_word` elements, is the `goto` acceptable, or would you rather see the code rewritten without the `goto`?\r\n3. Do we want to default to having this turned on?",

(FAST_FLOAT)\r\n\r\nThe idea implemented here is to have the Serialize and DeSerialize functions (in TFile and elsewhere) do any necessary conversions between the run-time type and file-storage (persisted) type.\r\n\r\nSee for example this bit of code from serialis.h:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // Serialize data.\r\n  bool Serialize(const std::string &data);\r\n  bool Serialize(const std::vector<char> &data);\r\n  template <typename T>\r\n  bool Serialize(const T* data, size_t count = 1) {\r\n\t  return FWrite(data, sizeof(T), count) == static_cast<int>(count);\r\n  }\r\n  template <typename T, typename ST>\r\n  bool Serialize(const T *data, size_t count = 1) {\r\n\t  ST* arr = new ST[count];\r\n  \t  for (size_t i = 0; i < count; i++)\r\n\t  {\r\n\t\tarr[i] = data[i];\r\n\t  }\r\n\t  bool rv = (FWrite(&arr[0], sizeof(ST), count) == static_cast<int>(count));\r\n\t  delete[] arr;\r\n\t  return rv;\r\n  }\r\n  template <typename T, typename ST>\r\n  bool Serialize(const std::vector<T>& data)\r\n  {\r\n\t  std::vector<ST> arr;\r\n\t\tsize_t len = data.size();\r\n\t\tarr.resize(len);\r\n\t\tfor (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {\r\n\t\t\tarr[i] = data[i];\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tbool rv = Serialize(arr);\r\n\t\treturn rv;\r\n  }\r\n  template <typename T>\r\n  bool Serialize(const std::vector<T> &data) {\r\n    // Serialize number of elements first.\r\n    uint32_t size = data.size();\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich now has the extra Serialize() members:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  template <typename T, typename ST>\r\n  bool Serialize(const T *data, size_t count = 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n  template <typename T, typename ST>\r\n  bool Serialize(const std::vector<T>& data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `T` represents the run-time type (Tfloat) and `ST` represents the *storage type* (`double` for new data files; `float` for old scales[] data).\r\n\r\nThen the code can easily dictate what the output to disk is going to be and thus be cross-compatible with other builds, which have their FAST_FLOAT /un/defined, e.g. this snippet from `weightmatrix.cpp`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbool WeightMatrix::Serialize(bool training, TFile *fp) const {\r\n  // For backward compatibility, add kDoubleFlag to mode to indicate the doubles\r\n  // format, without errs, so we can detect and read old format weight matrices.\r\n  uint8_t mode = (int_mode_ ? kInt8Flag : 0) | (use_adam_ ? kAdamFlag : 0) | kDoubleFlag;\r\n  if (!fp->Serialize(&mode)) {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n  if (int_mode_) {\r\n    if (!wi_.Serialize<int8_t>(fp)) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    // The scales stored in memory have an extra factor applied to them\r\n    // to allow faster operation. We have to remove that factor here\r\n    // before writing to disc.\r\n    auto scales = scales_;\r\n    for (auto &scale : scales) {\r\n      scale *= INT8_MAX;\r\n    }\r\n    uint32_t size = scales.size();\r\n    if (!fp->Serialize(&size)) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    if (!fp->Serialize<TFloat, double>(&scales[0], size)) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n  } else {\r\n    if (!wf_.Serialize<double>(fp)) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    if (training) {\r\n      if (!updates_.Serialize<double>(fp)) {\r\n        return false;\r\n      }\r\n      if (use_adam_ && !dw_sq_sum_.Serialize<double>(fp)) {\r\n        return false;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the `<float>` and `<double>` usage there: this in the function calls: these now dictate the output format (and at a place in the code where this is relevant: now this code remains easy to read as the file format can be read off the code lines without any trouble).\r\n\r\nI hope you like it. The commit list attached to this pullreq is a mess: disregard anything but the last couple commits (a cleaned up pullreq will follow next day), where this work was done (including work on AVX/SSE code to cope with the new float vs double TFloat approach: \r\n\r\n- SHA-1: 31de23df5f55f127b69c29de8057ea9b0bfe6154 = Continued work on SHA-1: d39706531a32f54aaacdfef39c49bae7f3eedf54 --> Part 2\r\n- SHA-1: d39706531a32f54aaacdfef39c49bae7f3eedf54 = Part 1: redesigned the TFloat approach using templates for the Serialization and Deserialization methods.

This typically improves the performance significantly and still works for lines with much inverted text.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the OCR result of the inverted image is now accepted if its mean confidence is better than the original one.

I used built-in [CMakePackageConfigHelpers](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CMakePackageConfigHelpers.html?highlight=configure_package_config_file#command:configure_package_config_file) to generate portable and standard config rules.\r\n2. `cmake/templates/TesseractConfig-version.cmake.in` is no longer needed because it will generated by [this](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CMakePackageConfigHelpers.html?highlight=configure_package_config_file#generating-a-package-version-file) command (will be named `TesseractConfigVersion.cmake` as mentioned in the command).\r\n3. `Tesseract_VERSION`, `Tesseract_VERSION_MAJOR` and `Tesseract_VERSION_MINOR` will be generated automatically from version file ([documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-packages.7.html#package-version-file)).\r\n4. I added `Tesseract::` namespace to imported targets, as is usually done in other projects, and updated the instructions for use to use imported targets instead:\r\n\r\n```cmake\r\nfind_package(Tesseract REQUIRED)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(MY_TARGET_NAME Tesseract::libtesseract)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocumentation [says](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-developer.7.html?highlight=namespace#a-sample-find-module):\r\n\r\n> When providing imported targets, these should be namespaced (hence the Foo:: prefix)\r\n\r\nBut let me know if you disagree with this change, I will just undo last commit.\r\n\r\n**Other suggestions:**\r\n\r\n1. Usually library targets in CMake named with capital letter and without `lib` prefix. Like `SDL2` or `QtWidgets` (the `lib` prefix will be automatically added to the compiled library on UNIX systems). So, if you agree with `4`, then maybe rename libtesseract target to Tesseract (or at least to just `tesseract`)? We can provide an alias for old name for compatibility.\r\n2. Project supports Autotools and most Linux distributions use this build system. But when using it, no CMake Config file is created. Leptonica does not have this issue: [configure.ac](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/35638dc450dbbe47377927de82fabd47f7692c0c/configure.ac#L261). Can I send a PR for it?",

Lots of work has been done on this already, including optimised integer based versions with SIMD implementations.\r\n\r\nThe last stage of these implementations involve biasing, scaling and writing the results out to memory.\r\n\r\nTraditionally that stage has always had to be done outside of the SIMD. By tweaking the calculation slightly (so as to give the same results), we can push that calculation into the SIMD section. The downside to doing that is that we buffer overrun the biases and scales as we read them and we buffer overrun the outputs as we write them.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the storage for the biases is already rounded, so the buffer overrun there is no problem. By adjusting the storage for the scales and the outputs, we can similarly ensure that the buffer overruns there are no problem either.\r\n\r\nThis results in a noticeable speedup. Running tesseract on 8087_054.3G.tif, runtime drops from 2.681s (real), 8.582 (user) to 2.582 (real), 8.174 (user) for identical results (times from an x86 box).\r\n",

        "body": "Layout analysis delivers segments that often need to be non-rectangular to accomodate close neighbours, image near text, ragged/unaligned lines etc. The CLI builds on the internal, polygon-based data structures, which allow for that without conflicts/overlaps. But API users up until now could only use bounding boxes, because `BlockPolygon` did not deliver correct coordinates:\r\n\r\n1. unlike `BoundingBox`, they were not \"unrotated\" (i.e. the internal deskewing has not been compensated for, giving coordinates widely out of scope)\r\n2. unlike `BoundingBox`, they were not clipped (i.e. forced into the interval of the image/rectangle)\r\n\r\nBoth issues have been fixed here. \r\n\r\nBut there is a third problem that I have not tackled yet: Polygon paths are often self-intersecting or otherwise unusable. This even confuses Tesseract itself when it tries to provide `GetImage()` on the raw image (i.e. when passed non-null `original_img`). It's not even enough to take the convex hull of these invalid paths. (My guess is that there is a bug in the incremental aggregation of the polyblock segments, in how it orders them, depending on their orientation.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is already much more usable than before. I can provide example images if necessary.",

I have not done this work for the Tesseract 3 portions of training because IIRC, the old 3.x engine might get scrapped. If there's a need I can convert that too; the process is pretty mechanical. \r\n\r\nPython 3.6+ is required, which also ships with Ubuntu 18.04 and is always installed. I need Python 3.6 for its improved string substitution - this makes it follow the bash version more closely,\r\n\r\nI attempted to keep source changes minimal so it would be easier to compare\r\nbash to Python in code review and confirm equivalence. The first commit is structured so it's somewhat easier to compare to the originals in bash, e.g. keeping Python and bash the same for the rare cases where they are the same. The second is cleaned to PEP8 so it deviates further. I definitely appreciate anyone checking whether I've mistranslated something. ( #1503 suggests language_specific.py being presented in YAML, and I agree that would be better, but for now I want to avoid major restructuring.)\r\n\r\nThere are minor improvements already but it's more or less functionally equivalent for LSTM training. Python's logging library is used and the log file is handled more consistently. Console output is more terse when things are going well. There are progress bars. Temporary files are retained on failure, for inspection. It's generally easier to use.\r\n\r\nThe .cpp utilities generally depend on portions of the Tesseract code base.

In particular, this takes into account macOS's wonky `libtool` semantics, which involve the following idiosyncrasies:  \r\n\r\n* The version of `libtool` that Apple bundles within both Xcode and its separate associated 'Command-Line Developer Tools' package comes _without_ a copy of `libtoolize`.  \r\n* macOS package managers like Homebrew and MacPorts typically install the GNU versions of `libtool` and `libtoolize` as `glibtool` and `glibtoolize`, respectively, when needed by another package as a dependency or otherwise requested by an end-user.  \r\n\r\nThe pre-existing code which was _supposed_ to handle this case was _not_ resilient with respect to errors finding either the system copy or the GNU variant of `libtoolize`, as it ran _both_ `libtoolize` and `glibtoolize`, in _that_ order, _without_ checking for the existence of _either_ utility!  (From the `man` page of the copy of `bash` included with macOS 'El Capitan' v10.11.6, which is reported to be `GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin15)` by `bash --version`:  \r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> \u2026\r\n>\r\n> SHELL GRAMMAR\r\n>\r\n> \u2026\r\n>\r\n>    Lists\r\n>           A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;, &, &&, or ||,  and optionally terminated by one of ;, &, or <newline>.\r\n>\r\n>           Of  these  list  operators,  &&  and  || have equal precedence, followed by ; and &, which have equal precedence.\r\n>\r\n>           A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a list instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.\r\n>\r\n>           If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the  command  in  the  background in a subshell.

It seems on most systems (like Mac OS X and Linux) it is still defined as `0` when using `-std=c++11`. However, this is not the case on my FreeBSD system (10.2-RELEASE), where it being defined as `nullptr` causes the `reinterpret_cast` to be rejected:\n\n```\n./matrix.h:292:63: error: reinterpret_cast from 'nullptr_t' to 'BLOB_CHOICE_LIST *' is not allowed\n    : BandTriMatrix<BLOB_CHOICE_LIST *>(dimension, bandwidth, NOT_CLASSIFIED) {}\n                                                              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n./matrix.h:33:24: note: expanded from macro 'NOT_CLASSIFIED'\n#define NOT_CLASSIFIED reinterpret_cast<BLOB_CHOICE_LIST*>(NULL)\n                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n1 error generated.\n```\n\nSee http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast:\n\n> 9) The null pointer value of any pointer type can be converted to any other pointer type, resulting in the null pointer value of that type. Note that the null pointer constant nullptr or any other value of type std::nullptr_t cannot be converted to a pointer with reinterpret_cast: implicit conversion or static_cast should be used for this purpose.\n",
