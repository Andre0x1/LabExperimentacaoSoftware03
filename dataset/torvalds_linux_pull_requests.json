        "body": "While using ELAN touchpad's, there are messages flooding in journalctl and dmesg with incomplete report:\r\n`[  581.465203] i2c_hid i2c-ELAN1200:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (16/65535)`\r\n\r\nAlso there were the next bugs:\r\n\r\n- If you touch touchpad with 5 fingers, the driver dies immediately.\r\n- When you scroll anything, and release one finger, driver thought you are still scrolling\r\n\r\nRecently, I spoke to ELANTECH and they send me a patch suggested by Intel to fix this issue. It was a simple hack, so me and guys from [redhat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543769#c130) forum created this patch.\r\n\r\nIt is fixed by adding additional quirk to trigger `IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING` flag.\r\n\r\nAn explanation about why i2c_hid_init_irq section was moved under the i2c_hid_lookup_quirk, answered by Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>:\r\n\r\n> i2c_hid_init_irq now checks for a quirk, so we must setup the quirks before we init the irq, and we cannot setup the quirk earlier, so we must init the irq later.\r\n\r\nSo this commit revert's [this](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1475af255e18f35dc46f8a7acc18354c73d45149#diff-896178b83bacd485a53cd66e4cd7e2d0) commit, as no message flood can be seen by now, and fixes touchpad problems.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Vladislav Dalechyn <hotwater438@tutanota.com>",

For URLs where the content was not available, I first checked the `article` subdomain of Gmane, which has some content not available on the `thread` and `comments` subdomains.\n\n  If the content wasn't anywhere on Gmane's web interface, I resolved the URL to a [Message-ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-ID) via the Gmane NNTP interface and tried to find the Message-ID on other mailing list archivers. I checked `mail-archive.com`, then `marc.info`, then `lists.debian.org` and so on.\n\n  If a new URL was found, I replaced it in this pull request.

MRP used to lose JoinIn messages and never retry if it sent messages before the interface became ready.\n\nThe periodic timer from the 802.1Q spec never turns off.  It fires every second, causing MRP to bounce from state QA to AA and back. You might think that would stop when the registrar responds with an JoinIn, but there's no state in the MRP state table to ignore the periodic timer after getting a reply.  The result is MRP sends a JoinIn message every second.  This may not be desirable, but it's what the spec requires.\n\n[802.1Q-2011]\nhttp://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.1Q-2011.html\n",
