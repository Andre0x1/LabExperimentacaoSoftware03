        "body": "The previous implementation of merge sort used the array.shift() method to merge elements from leftArray and rightArray into the sorted array. This is a bad practice, because JavaScript's implementation of the Array.prototype.shift() method is, at worst, O(n) runtime complexity, where n is the length of the array being sorted (in order to move n elements of an array over by 1, all n elements of the array must typically be touched).\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I refactored merge sort to use array pointers instead. Now, after an element has been added to the sorted array, rather than delete it from the old array and shift the entire old array over, the array index pointer is just incremented to the right by one to avoid the old element. This will always require O(1) runtime complexity, which is a significant performance boost.\r\n\r\nI also added two simple concat() statements to the returned sortedArray value, because the length of the left and right arrays can no longer be used to determine if an element is still \"dangling\" (needing to be added to the sorted array).\r\n\r\nAll tests passed after my changes.\r\n\r\n[Quick Stack Overflow info on JavaScript array method runtime complexities](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22614237/javascript-runtime-complexity-of-array-functions)",

This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper. \n>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\n>   published recently.\n> \n> Compatibility notes: \n> \n> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return \n>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.\n> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n> \n> ```js\n> {\n>   __proto__: 'some string'\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only \n>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\n>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\n>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n> \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3)\n> \n> ## v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\n> # Bugfixes\n> \n> - fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\n> - test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - no incompatibility are to be expected\n></tr></table> ...

It's using the boolean logic to cover all possible cases of adding two input bits: with and without a \"carry bit\" from adding the previous less-significant stage.\r\n\r\nLegend:\r\n- `A`: Number `A`\r\n- `B`: Number `B`\r\n- `ai`: ith bit of number `A`\r\n- `bi`: ith bit of number `B`\r\n- `carryIn`: a bit carried in from the previous less-significant stage\r\n- `carryOut`: a bit to carry to the next most-significant stage\r\n- `bitSum`: The sum of `ai`, `bi`, and `carryIn`\r\n- `resultBin`: The full result of adding current stage with all less-significant stages (in binary)\r\n- `resultBin`: The full result of adding current stage with all less-significant stages (in decimal)\r\n```\r\nA = 3: 011\r\nB = 6: 110\r\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\r\n\u2502  bit \u2502 ai \u2502 bi \u2502 carryIn \u2502 carryOut \u2502  bitSum \u2502 resultBin \u2502 resultDec \u2502\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\r\n\u2502   0  \u2502 1  \u2502 0  \u2502    0    \u2502    0     \u2502     1   \u2502       1   \u2502     1     \u2502\r\n\u2502   1  \u2502 1  \u2502 1  \u2502    0    \u2502    1     \u2502     0   \u2502      01   \u2502     1     \u2502\r\n\u2502   2  \u2502 0  \u2502 1  \u2502    1    \u2502    1     \u2502     0   \u2502     001   \u2502     1     \u2502\r\n\u2502   3  \u2502 0  \u2502 0  \u2502    1    \u2502    0     \u2502     1   \u2502    1001   \u2502     9     \u2502\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\r\n```\r\n\r\n> See [fullAdder.js](fullAdder.js) for further details.  \r\n> See [Full Adder on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJc9CZcvBc).",
