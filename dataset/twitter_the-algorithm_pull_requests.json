The safety label type `UkraineCrisisTopic` has been removed from the code, and the categorization of safety label types has been updated to ensure consistency and accuracy.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank everyone for their contributions and effort in getting this pull request merged, and I hope these changes will help improve the safety and trust of Twitter's platform for all users. Your effort and dedication have been instrumental in making these changes possible, and I am honored to be a part of such a supportive and collaborative community.\r\n\r\nVisibility Filtering\r\n=============\r\n\r\nVisibility Filtering is a rule engine that centrally instructs the client on adjusting the display of specific content at read time. This library is responsible for _\"filtering content to support legal compliance, improve product quality, increase user trust, protect revenue through hard-filtering, visible product treatments, and coarse-grained downranking\"_.\r\n\r\n### Types\r\n\r\nThe library utilizes three primary concepts to support this:\r\n\r\n* `SafetyLevel`: represents the context in which content is viewed\r\n* `SafetyLabel`: identifies content as potentially harmful\r\n* `SafetyLabelType` specifies the type of policy violation\r\n* `SpaceSafetyLabelType` groups safety labels based on content characteristics\r\n\r\n### Categories\r\n\r\nIt is possible to logically categorize them into three groups:\r\n\r\n1. **Content Classification**\r\n   * `CoordinatedHarmfulActivityHighRecall`\r\n   * `HatefulHighRecall`\r\n   * `ViolenceHighRecall`\r\n   * `CivicIntegrityMisinfo`\r\n   * `MedicalMisinfo`\r\n   * `GenericMisinfo`\r\n   * `MisleadingHighRecall`\r\n   * `NsfwHighPrecision`\r\n   * `NsfwHighRecall`\r\n   * `UntrustedUrl`\r\n2. **Content Moderation**\r\n   * `DoNotAmplify`\r\n   * `DoNotPublicPublish`\r\n   * `DmcaWithheld`\r\n   * `HighToxicityModelScore`\r\n3. **Status**\r\n   * `Deprecated`\r\n   * `Unknown`\r\n\r\nThe safety label `UkraineCrisisTopic` [on line 39](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/blame/ec83d01dcaebf369444d75ed04b3625a0a645eb9/visibilitylib/src/main/scala/com/twitter/visibility/models/SpaceSafetyLabelType.scala#L39) is an outlier to the categorization because it does not fit into any defined category.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the term _\"crisis\"_ is not similar to the other safety label types defined in the code. While the other safety label types refer to specific characteristics of content that may pose a risk or harm to users, _\"crisis\"_ is a broader term that refers to a situation or event that poses a significant challenge or threat to individuals, organizations, or communities. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n========\r\n\r\nAs a result, I propose to remove `UkraineCrisisTopic` from the code. This change helps maintain consistency in categorizing safety label types and ensures that all labels have specific characteristics that may pose a risk or harm to users.\r\n\r\nContent Moderation\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThe safety label type `UkraineCrisisTopic` represents a specific safety label designed to flag content related to the ongoing war in Ukraine. \r\n\r\nWhen a tweet is flagged with this safety label, it indicates that the tweet's content is related to the topic, and tweets with this label may undergo additional review or may be excluded from specific features, such as trending topics.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the language used in the code is not politically correct, which may offend some users. Additionally, with recent staff cuts in Twitter's Trust and Safety and Global Content Moderation team, it is unclear whether these flagged tweets are being reviewed and actioned.\r\n\r\nReference in Code\r\n==============\r\n\r\n[s.SpaceSafetyLabelType.UkraineCrisisTopic -> UkraineCrisisTopic](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/blame/ec83d01dcaebf369444d75ed04b3625a0a645eb9/visibilitylib/src/main/scala/com/twitter/visibility/models/SpaceSafetyLabelType.scala#L39)\r\n\r\n```java\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.DoNotAmplify -> DoNotAmplify,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.CoordinatedHarmfulActivityHighRecall -> CoordinatedHarmfulActivityHighRecall,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.UntrustedUrl -> UntrustedUrl,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.MisleadingHighRecall -> MisleadingHighRecall,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.NsfwHighPrecision -> NsfwHighPrecision,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.NsfwHighRecall -> NsfwHighRecall,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.CivicIntegrityMisinfo -> CivicIntegrityMisinfo,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.MedicalMisinfo -> MedicalMisinfo,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.GenericMisinfo -> GenericMisinfo,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.DmcaWithheld -> DmcaWithheld,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.HatefulHighRecall -> HatefulHighRecall,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.ViolenceHighRecall -> ViolenceHighRecall,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.HighToxicityModelScore -> HighToxicityModelScore,\r\n// s.SpaceSafetyLabelType.UkraineCrisisTopic -> UkraineCrisisTopic,\r\ns.SpaceSafetyLabelType.DoNotPublicPublish -> DoNotPublicPublish,\r\n```\r\n[case object UkraineCrisisTopic extends SpaceSafetyLabelType](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/blame/ec83d01dcaebf369444d75ed04b3625a0a645eb9/visibilitylib/src/main/scala/com/twitter/visibility/models/SpaceSafetyLabelType.scala#L72)\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncase object DoNotAmplify extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object CoordinatedHarmfulActivityHighRecall extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object UntrustedUrl extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object MisleadingHighRecall extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object NsfwHighPrecision extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object NsfwHighRecall extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object CivicIntegrityMisinfo extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object MedicalMisinfo extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object GenericMisinfo extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object DmcaWithheld extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object HatefulHighRecall extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object ViolenceHighRecall extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object HighToxicityModelScore extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\n// case object UkraineCrisisTopic extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\ncase object DoNotPublicPublish extends SpaceSafetyLabelType\r\n```",

Specifically, made the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Moved the creation of the stats counters (`totalRequestsCounter`, `emptyResponsesCounter`, `locationServiceExceptionCounter`, `reverseGeocodeExceptionCounter`) to where they are used, inside the `getGeohashAndCountryCode` method, to avoid creating them unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n- Simplified the creation of `lscLocationStitch` and `ipLocationStitch` by using `Stitch.collect` instead of wrapping the `Option` in a `Stitch` and using `Stitch.collect` inside it.\r\n\r\n- Combined the matching of `geohash` and `countryCode` into a single pattern match on a tuple, instead of using `flatMap` and `orElse`.\r\n\r\n- Removed the `private val` definitions for the stats counters and used them directly in the method, to avoid unnecessary indirection.\r\n\r\nThese changes improve the performance of the `getGeohashAndCountryCode` method by reducing unnecessary object creation and function calls, while also making the code easier to read and maintain.\r\n\r\n[My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/wgw0)\r\n",

We have then removed the biased module and made corresponding changes to ensure that the feature is now fair and unbiased for all users.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this fix will significantly improve the user experience on Twitter and ensure that our platform is accessible and equitable for all.

First, I have moved the README file from its previous location in a nested folder (`navi/navi`) to the root folder (`navi`). This change should make it easier to find and access the file, especially for new users who are not familiar with the project's directory structure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the structural changes, I have also made several improvements to the grammar and readability of the document. Specifically, I have corrected grammar mistakes and rephrased several sections for clarity. These changes should make the README more accessible and understandable for all users.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback or questions about these changes.",

We can use various techniques to determine the relevance of a tweet, such as keyword matching, sentiment analysis, and user interaction history.\r\n\r\nAssuming that we have a function `getRelevance(tweet: Tweet, user: User): Double` that returns the relevance score of a tweet to a user, we can sort a list of tweets by relevance using the `sortBy` method in Scala. Here's an example implementation:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase class Tweet(text: String, author: String, timestamp: Long)\r\ncase class User(interests: List[String])\r\n\r\ndef getRelevance(tweet: Tweet, user: User): Double = {\r\n  // TODO: Implement relevance scoring algorithm\r\n  0.0\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef sortTweetsByRelevance(tweets: List[Tweet], user: User): List[Tweet] = {\r\n  tweets.sortBy(tweet => -getRelevance(tweet, user))\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Example usage:\r\nval tweets = List(\r\n  Tweet(\"I love dogs\", \"Alice\", 1648777200),\r\n  Tweet(\"Just ate a delicious pizza\", \"Bob\", 1648777300),\r\n  Tweet(\"Breaking news: Earthquake in Japan\", \"CNN\", 1648777400),\r\n  Tweet(\"Check out my new blog post about gardening\", \"Alice\", 1648777500)\r\n)\r\nval user = User(List(\"dogs\", \"gardening\"))\r\nval relevantTweets = sortTweetsByRelevance(tweets, user)\r\nprintln(relevantTweets)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `sortTweetsByRelevance` function takes a list of tweets and a user object, and returns a new list of tweets sorted by relevance to the user. The `getRelevance` function takes a tweet and a user, and returns a relevance score as a double. The tweets are sorted in descending order of relevance by passing a negated relevance score to the `sortBy` method. Finally, we print the sorted list of tweets using the `println` method.\r\n\r\nNote that the `getRelevance` function is left unimplemented in this example, as the exact algorithm will depend on the specific requirements of the application.",
