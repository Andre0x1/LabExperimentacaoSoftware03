This is done in both the compiled template and the \"lookup\"-helper. \n>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\n>   published recently.\n> \n> Compatibility notes: \n> \n> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return \n>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.\n> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:\n> \n> ```js\n> {\n>   __proto__: 'some string'\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only \n>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\n>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\n>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.\n> \n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3)\n> \n> ## v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019\n> # Bugfixes\n> \n> - fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for \"constructor\" - d541378\n> - test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - no incompatibility are to be expected\n></tr></table> ...

The old module which was available by the name [node-uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-uuid) got deprecated and will show error message upon every install of the module.\n\nTo get rid of those install errors I've created this **automated pull request**. I've run some checks against your code base to test whether you're using one of the [deprecated apis](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid/commit/5ae7287fc935eb55ef39133e4be17ef623ca000e), but this isn't the case.\n\n\nPlease test the changes against your code. I didn't run any tests and therefore can't guarantee that it isn't breaking. You can also just close this pr if you don't want to update your module.\n\nIn case there's already another pr open to upgrade uuid, I'm sorry for the effort I'm causing.",

You can customize this container using a Dockerfile.\n- Source code is automatically cloned into the workspace as a \u201clocal\u201d copy.\n- A command set is added so users can build / run / debug the project with a single click.\n- The project is automatically run so a new user can experience it hassle-free.\n- A pull request panel in the IDE simplifies the process of creating a PR for new users. Experienced users can use the git menu in the IDE, or issue git commands from the built-in terminal.\n\nThis does not require **_any changes**_ to the source code and has **_no cost**_ to you or your users.\n",

To not conflict with loading nested lists, because of three parameter, I had to handle the nested after the plurals in router/index.js\n2. I had problems with the tests. I don't know what they the two problems are, I was still able to load nested objects.\n3. The test that is loading the database from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/db was very fragile at my location. I am in Shanghai/China so it often fails to download. To push to git, I needed 4 times to let this test pass.\n\np.s. I really love the simplicity of the JSON-Server. Recently I was at a conference, there was a talk about the sails.js API. and there also an support for both, http-RequestsTypes and specifying updates with a GET Request.\n\nI have more planes to develop for the JSON-Server. But that might become separate modules.\n",
