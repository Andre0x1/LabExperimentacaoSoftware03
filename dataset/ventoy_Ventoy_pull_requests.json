We believe we understand the intention of the type casts in the above if statement. It seems they were meant to ensure an underflow doesn\u2019t occur by the subtraction between to char pointers, which is a great catch (!). However, we believe the way the type casts are structured, the code is not actually protecting against such underflow because pwdstr isn\u2019t cast into a signed long until after the subtraction occurs. To properly protect this code against underflow, we believe it should be changed to something like the following:\r\n\r\n`if (len - 1 - ((long)pos \u2013 (long)pwdstr) != 32)`\r\n\r\nOr, to enhance readability for junior engineers who may not know that the \u201clong\u201d type cast is implicitly of a signed integer type, we could include the `signed` keyword for added verbosity:\r\n \r\n`if (len - 1 - ((signed long)pos \u2013 (signed long)pwdstr) != 32)`\r\n \r\nThank you!",

Many Linux users (including myself) prefer using these `/dev/disk/by-id` symlinks instead of raw device names (especially for dangerous operations such as formatting a device) since this reduces the probability of accidentally using an incorrect device.\r\n\r\nThis PR will resolve the symlink in the beginning of `VentoyWorker.sh` (directly when parsing the command-line arguments).",

If a newer version exists, it will download that version in the same directory.\r\n\r\n## Future scope of this change:\r\n- Could be added to automate updates within app.\r\n- This approach also allows to get the change-log using `$release.body`.\r\n\r\n## Notes:\r\n- I have enable the `Allow edits by maintainers` option in this pull request so that the maintainer can place this file in the proper location if they choose to integrate it upstream.\r\n- I will be happy to create a bash script achieving the same result. I did not do that since Linux already has package managers and updating happens through them.",
