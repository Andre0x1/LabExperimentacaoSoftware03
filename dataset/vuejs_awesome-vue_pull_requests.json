It was initially modeled after the [Hacker News Clone](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/hackernews.html). The routing is handled by vuex and all pages are generated through the Vue Templates. In addition to a few modules ( including but not limited to `vue-router`, `vue-clickaway`, `vue-meta`, `vue-server-renderer` ) there are numerous custom components built in vue / vuex style.

Quasar Framework which has been added on a later date than Vuetify or vue-material, is now the first on the list. Is it perhaps ordered by popularity? I doubt it, so I placed Vuikit first as if you check the History it is where it belongs.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't checked the entire list, and there could be other listing with older history. The Vuetify it self should go before Quasar, etc... If I got a clarification about the order, I could reorder the list accordingly in a new PR.",

It took me a lot of time to develop it since I'm a diplomat not a programmer. So, I had to learn Javascript, how to use Git and a lot of tools first. Also I experimented with many concepts before achieving what I wanted. I always wanted to create a library to build apps or sites that use zoomable navigation. I think Zircle may be work for building UIs for IoT, health & fitness apps, mini-dashboards, among other potencial implementations.",

The basement is simply a part (or all) of your vuex state that, optionally, can be made persisting, as well as being shared, accessable and reactive from any tab/window. This is accomplished through defining the paths of your state that form the persistant \"basement\" state, as well as adding the powerful global commit action to your vuex store, which allows you to issue a commit from any tab to all open tabs/windows, effectively synchronizing the app state across those tabs/windows.\r\n\r\n[Github Repo Link](https://github.com/RashadSaleh/vuex-basement)",
