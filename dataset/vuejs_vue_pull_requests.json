This may cause this error when meeting frozen variables. Ofcourse this error can also happen when using readonly directly on frozen objects.\r\n\r\nsolvement:\r\nThis fix can simply solve the issue by checking the extensibility of target, and keep the temp proxy at the same time, but leaving existing proxy cache useless. The main reason is the \"isReadonly\" judgement, but it's difficult to change this basic feature, and the frozen target may still contain not frozen things? As this case may happen rarely, this fix is enough now and willing for future improvements.\r\n\r\n",

This is explained in more detail in the attached video.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation in this case is to write the standard HTML tags always in lowercase (in fact, in Vue 3 a \"failed to resolve component\" warning is displayed when an uppercase tag is used, even when it's still rendered).\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch\r\n- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [x] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [ ] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889025/149219636-254a6ebf-7f56-4d76-9de6-d8eed439a1e0.mp4\r\n\r\n*P.S.: I just realized I didn't show the fixed version working as expected in the video (I forgot to modify the input during the demo).

The original intent of the build was to only run Codecov on non-PRs. But it seems like every commit has an associated PR now. The [Codecov page](https://app.codecov.io/gh/vuejs/vue) shows no commits for the past year, and viewing any build of a commit in that timeframe (e.g. [6e22f770](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/vuejs/vue/784/workflows/dd6d5796-ada9-44ff-9b4b-27dd8bb9558a/jobs/18103)) will show that `CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST` and `CI_PULL_REQUEST` are set.\r\n\r\nIn any case, no coverage report has been uploaded in quite some time. I realize that this will change the PR experience for users, so happy to change this to whatever makes the most sense for Vue.\r\n\r\nI have also bumped up the npm Codecov version to latest.\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [x] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch\r\n- [ ] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [ ] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [ ] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\nThe npm version of the uploader is being deprecated in favor of the new universal uploader.

        "body": "The [original issue #10184](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/10184) is too long, and I've made some mistakes when writing it.\r\n\r\nHere, I will rephrase the issue, and explain my solution.\r\n\r\n## What problem?\r\n\r\n### Demos\r\n\r\nHere are two demo for comparison.\r\n\r\n1. [Vanilla vue.js warns when assigment in v-if happens](https://codepen.io/grandsong/pen/xoLxvM)\r\n2. [My modified vue.js doesn't warn when assigment in v-if happens](https://codepen.io/grandsong/pen/PrKwQj)\r\n\r\nRemember to open Dev Tools and check the Console.\r\n\r\nThe code in question is `<span v-if=\"pet = person.pet\">`.\r\n\r\n### What happens in vanilla vue.js?\r\n\r\nvue.js doesn't check the content of the expression of a `v-if`.\r\n\r\nTo it, `pet = person.pet` is just an arbitrary expression.\r\n\r\nIt desn't care whether assigment happens in a `v-if`.\r\n\r\nAll if conditions will be compiled as ternary statements.\r\n\r\nIn the example, the compiled codes will be like:\r\n\r\n  \t((pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)\r\n\r\nAs a result, while the template is being rendered, at the beginning when the renderer meets this identifier `pet`, the **proxy** of vue instane (let's name it as `vm`) will automatically try to get `pet` as a property of the instance.\r\n\r\nOf course it will fail. `vm.pet` has not been defined yet.\r\nSo, a **warning** will be thrown.\r\n\r\n    [Vue warn]: Property or method \"pet\" is not defined on the instance but referenced during render.\r\n\r\nThen, the renderer meets `= person.pet`, so it assigns the `pet` as a property of the vue instance, namely, `vm.pet = person.pet`.\r\n\r\nAfter that, when it meets `pet` again in `pet.name`, it gets `pet` (namely, `vm.pet`) successfully.\r\n\r\nIf we would manually do the rendering in place of vue (without the help of the magical proxy and its get-handler), we will deal with codes like this:\r\n\r\n    ((vm.pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${vm.pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)\r\n\r\nA spoiler: `person` is different. It doesn't bother the proxy.\r\n\r\n## Why do we need assigment in v-if?\r\n\r\nWhy do we need any shorthand (like `:` for `v-bind:`), or sugar syntax (`for in` instead of `for(var ..;..<..length;..++)`), etc?\r\n\r\nMaking life easier!\r\n\r\nWe can live with inconvenience. But we still ask for better life when we have chance.\r\n\r\n#### The above demos\r\n\r\nWithout the assigment, the codes would become\r\n\r\n    <span v-if=\"person.pet\">{{person.name}}'s pet's name is {{person.pet.name}}.</span>\r\n\r\nWell, looks completely tolerable...\r\n\r\nBut, what if the design is more complex?\r\n\r\n    <span v-if=\"person.pet\">\r\n    \t<span v-if=\"person.pet.hunger > 0\">\r\n    \t\t{{person.name}}'s pet's {{person.pet.name}} needs to eat\r\n    \t\t<span> {{foodDict[person.pet.favFoodId]}}</span>\r\n    \t\t, which\r\n    \t\t<span v-if=\"foodQtyInStore[person.pet.favFoodId]\"> you have {{foodQtyInStore[person.pet.favFoodId]}}.</span>\r\n    \t\t<span v-else class=\"color-warning\"> is out of stock!<span>\r\n    \t</span>\r\n    </span>\r\n\r\nCompare it with\r\n\r\n    <span v-if=\"pet = person.pet\">\r\n    \t<span v-if=\"pet.hunger > 0\">\r\n    \t\t{{person.name}}'s pet's {{pet.name}} needs to eat\r\n    \t\t<span> {{foodDict[pet.favFoodId].name}}</span>\r\n    \t\t, which\r\n    \t\t<span v-if=\"foodQty = foodQtyInStore[pet.favFoodId]\"> you have {{foodQty}}.</span>\r\n    \t\t<span v-else class=\"color-warning\"> is out of stock!<span>\r\n    \t</span>\r\n    </span>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `slotScope`\r\n\r\nAnd let's take another example - an example in the source of **vue.js itself**:\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction processSlotContent (el) {\r\n\t\t  let slotScope\r\n\t\t  if (el.tag === 'template') {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t  } else if ((slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope'))) {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t    el.slotScope = slotScope\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t  ...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n(It purposely uses double brackets to fool lint-flow-types, which forbids assigment in if.)\r\n\r\nWithout the assigment, it would become\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction processSlotContent (el) {\r\n\t\t  let slotScope\r\n\t\t  if (el.tag === 'template') {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t  } else if (getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')) {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t    el.slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t  ...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is OK for `getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')` to be called twice.\r\nProbably not.\r\n\r\nMaybe we still have to use assigment, just not in if-condition.\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction processSlotContent (el) {\r\n\t\t  let slotScope\r\n\t\t  if (el.tag === 'template') {\r\n\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t  } else {\r\n\t\t\t  slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')\r\n\t\t\t\tif (slotScope) {\r\n\t\t\t    ...\r\n\t\t\t    el.slotScope = slotScope\r\n\t\t\t  }\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t  ...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n#### `if let`\r\n\r\nAnother thing we can analogize to is the `if let` in Swift.\r\n\r\nSee [Optional Binding](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html#ID333) if you haven't learnt it or don't quite recall.\r\n\r\nBefore I learnt this feature of Swift, I was very reluctant to assigment in if-condition.\r\n\r\nBecause it would remind me of my several stupid mistakes of `=` for `==` as well as my old time as a JS newbie.\r\n\r\nI would rather write more codes (like the `slotScope` one) to avoid assigment in if-condition.\r\n\r\nBut Swift gave me a good lesson.\r\nSmart people should embrace useful features when opportunity allows (designing a new language).\r\n\r\n#### What about danger?\r\n\r\nIn pure JS, thanks to js linters, assigment in if-condition is not as dangerous as it used to be. Mistakes of `=` for `==` can be easily detected.\r\n\r\n(That's why [#7631 warn when assignment in v-if in development mode](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7631) was closed by @posva.)\r\n\r\n## Then, what's wrong with vue?\r\n\r\nIn vue, it is another story.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to easily create local variables yet.\r\n\r\nSo, even if I just want assignment outside v-if, I cannot assign at all.\r\n\r\n(There is [a solution](https://github.com/posva/vue-local-scope) for `slot-scope`. But I seldom use slots.)\r\n\r\nWhether we deserve such freedom is beyond this issue. Let's leave it and focus on assignment in `v-if`.\r\n\r\nPlease remember these fact:\r\n\r\n- assignment in `v-if` **already** works\r\n\r\n- the warning thrown is not very helpful\r\n\r\nThe warning is thrown, not because vue has a rule which forbids assignment in `v-if`, but because vue fails to recognize the identifier as a new one, which of course is not defined.\r\n\r\n### And, bug?\r\n\r\nAnd there can be possible conflict (I don't know if it can be called a bug/loophole):\r\n\r\nIf somehow the developer writes\r\n\r\n\t\tdata() {\r\n      return {\r\n        b: false,\r\n        pet: {\r\n        \t// some other pet\r\n        \tname: 'Tom'\r\n      \t},\r\n        persons: [...]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow, there is `vm.pet` (Tom) before the template is rendered.\r\n\r\nSo, when the renderer meets `v-if=\"pet = perons.pet\"`, it will happily get it!\r\nAnd then, `vm.pet` will be overwritten and Tom will no longer exist!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compare `v-for`\r\n\r\n`v-for` naturally contains assignment.\r\n\r\nAlthough not mentioned in the doc, vue actually even \"[support destructuring assignment](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/8780)\". It is a little secret.\r\n\r\nSo, what goes on with `v-for`? Why identifiers in it doesn't lead to warnings?\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple: compiled codes for `v-for` are functions, so that the identifiers are local varibles within the functions.\r\n\r\nThat's why you dont' see `vm.person.name` in the \"If we would manually do the rendering\" code:\r\n\r\n    ((vm.pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${vm.pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)\r\n\r\nThis inspired me when I was trying to make a solution.\r\n\r\n## What solution?\r\n\r\nSimple.\r\n\r\nYou can see that I added/modified only very few lines below.\r\n\r\nQuick explanation:\r\n\r\n1. In \"parser/index.js\", `assignmentInIfRE` is define.\r\n\r\n2. In `function addIfCondition`, `assignmentInIfRE` is used to find the identifier, and store it as `condition.alias`.\r\n\r\n3. In \"codegen/index.js\", save the original compiled result to `ternaryExp`.\r\n\r\n4. If `condition.alias` exists, add a declaration of the identifier. Then, wrap the codes as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).\r\n\r\nWith IIFE, it works in a way very similar to the optional binding (`if let`) in Swift.\r\n\r\n### BTW, Why `alias`?\r\n\r\nThe parser for `v-for` stores identifiers (i.e. `person`) as `alias` of the node.\r\n\r\nI don't know what uses are of these aliases, but I like the choice of name.\r\n\r\n## Hey, no test yet? How dare you!\r\n\r\nSorry.\r\nI tried to follow the instruction but I failed to do the test.\r\nTwice.\r\n\r\nI run `yarn`, then I got stuck. It shows several \"waiting...\" **forever**.\r\n\r\nI had to stop it manually, and a rerun was no luck either.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've already made a **working** modified vue.js, in **my Demo 2**.\r\n\r\nSo I guess it is highly likely for my simple solution to run well with this pull request, too.\r\n\r\nBesides, there might be problems that I cannot anticipate.\r\nToday it was the first time I've delved into the source of vue.\r\n\r\nReal experts may be needed for polishing this feature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE -->\r\n<!-- (Update \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box) -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch\r\n- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [ ] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [x] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [x] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n",

It works by sending subscribers a few open issues in their inbox. If subscribers get busy, there is an algorithm that backs off issue load so they do not get overwhelmed\n\n[Read more about the CodeTriage project](https://www.codetriage.com/what).\n\n## Why am I getting this PR?\n\nYour project was picked by the human, @schneems. They selected it from the projects submitted to https://www.codetriage.com and hand edited the PR. How did your project get added to [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/what)? Roughly about 3 years ago, [mysmallidea](https://github.com/mysmallidea) added this project to CodeTriage in order to start contributing. Since then, 76 people have subscribed to help this repo.\n\n## What does adding a badge accomplish?\n\nAdding a badge invites people to help contribute to your project. It also lets developers know that others are invested in the longterm success and maintainability of the project.\n\nYou can see an example of a CodeTriage badge on these popular OSS READMEs:\n\n- [![Email clients like GMAIL do not render SVG images](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/rails/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/rails) https://github.com/rails/rails\n- [![Email clients like GMAIL do not render SVG images](https://www.codetriage.com/crystal-lang/crystal/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/crystal-lang/crystal) https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal\n\n## Have a question or comment?\n\nWhile I am a bot, this PR was manually reviewed and monitored by a human - @schneems. My job is writing commit messages and handling PR logistics.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can reply back to this PR and they will be answered by @schneems. If you do not want a badge right now, no worries, close the PR, you will not hear from me again.\n\nThanks for making your project Open Source! Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",

I decided to just go for it since it's a pretty small modification. Hopefully this explanation is enough, but I can always add an issue later if needed.\r\n- I'm pretty sure that I added all relevant tests and they all seem to have passed. I did experience an issue trying to run the ChromeHeadless instance on my PC, however, although I'm not sure if that test suite applies to this PR anyway (if it does please let me know and I'll try to get it fixed asap).\r\n- I'm using the default `NFC` form of unicode normalization. It might be worth considering adding the other forms as well (`NFD`,`NFKC`,`NFKD`).\r\n\r\nMore informaton on `String.normalize()` and its usefulness can be found in the following links:\r\n- [Why you need to normalize unicode strings](https://withblue.ink/2019/03/11/why-you-need-to-normalize-unicode-strings.html)\r\n- [String.normalize() \u00ad\u2014 MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize)",

        "body": "Ensure that state mutations that only affect parent scope only trigger parent update and does not affect child components with only scoped slots.\r\n\r\nImplications:\r\n\r\n- For optimal performance, scoped slots should always be preferred. (In v3 all slots are unified to work like scoped slots so that will be the default)\r\n\r\n- In 2.6, any slots using the new `v-slot` syntax are compiled as scopedSlots internally. This doesn't affect the child if it's using template, since `<slot/>` can render both scoped and normal slots, but if the child is using render functions, it is recommended to always use `this.$scopedSlots`. It is safe to do so in 2.6 since all normal slots are proxied on `this.$scopedSlots` as well.\r\n\r\n- Unfortunately, any child components with static slot content still need to be forced updated. This means the common use case of `<parent><child></child></parent>` doesn't benefit from this change, unless the default slot is explicitly forced into a scoped slot by using `<parent v-slot:default><child></child></parent>`. (We cannot directly force all slots into scoped slots as that would break existing render function code that expects the slot to be present on `this.$slots` instead of `this.$scopedSlots)",

Allows head management within `single file components` (see #9205)\r\n2. Allows async functions within the `template` option\r\n3. Makes the `vue-server-renderer` templater much easier to use, and allows users to use javascript interpolations. For example: `<!--vue-ssr-outlet-->` becomes `${result}`\r\n\r\n#### Bonus\r\nI'm creating a serverside rendering templating engine for **Vue** that will use this feature. It includes:\r\n- A super simple head management system that exists entirely within the `<template>`, like native html\r\n- full server-side rendering with Webpack\r\n- CommonJS based, so users can easily implement it into koa/express projects\r\n- templating using slots\r\n- runtime compilation of Vue files (which are cached)\r\n\r\nThe package is aimed for users who want to start using Vue but want to keep express/koa routing which will make building serverside applications much easier for users, and will increase Vue adoption in the process",

This allow's webpack (for those who want to opt-in to requiring vue's original source files (instead of the flattened esm bundles) and want to remove flow type through a babel-transform, then this will allow webpack to aggressively ignore and treeshake unused exports throughout the module system. \r\n\r\nIn many cases this can yield hidden and surprising build time improvements and size reductions in the case that modules flattened from rollup aren't actually needed when webpack performs a scope analysis. \r\n\r\nThe angular team has adopted this approach for the CLI yielding some strong build time speed for webpack (since unused exports are also not resolved, parsed, etc.). From my assessment of the module graph created, it looks that there are no sideEffects created against existing re-exports throughout the codebase, therefore even if a user did opt in on their own will, and remove flow types, there should be no danger of removing code that is needed and causing breakages. \r\n\r\nOverall, this already will not be a breaking change in any way but just provides extra benefits to those (and for the cli (if realized) when using webpack 4 and `mode: production`).\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any other questions.\r\n~Sean + [webpack team](https://github.com/webpack) \r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n",

So at least two processes should be changed to support this feature.\r\n\r\n**1. Using dynamic `this` for the event handler**\r\n\r\nWhen compiling the `v-on` directive, the expression will be compiled into a handler function. Along with the `with(this){}` magic, the handler function's context (`this`) always be same as the render function. But it should be dynamic for virtual components, the real context of the event handler could be re-assigned at runtime.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I added an explicit `this` to the event handlers which are used in recyclable components.  ([platforms/weex/compiler/modules/event.js#L45-L60](https://github.com/Hanks10100/vue/blob/6be2fc83130c1aa1cf696800a2b7fb23eec9f6e1/src/platforms/weex/compiler/modules/event.js#L45-L60)) \r\n\r\n**2. Finding the expected context when invoking the event handler.**\r\n\r\nAt runtime, if an event is dispatched to a virtual component template, then find the real context by `componentId` and invoke the handler in the expected context. ([platforms/weex/runtime/modules/events.js#L48-L65](https://github.com/Hanks10100/vue/blob/6be2fc83130c1aa1cf696800a2b7fb23eec9f6e1/src/platforms/weex/runtime/modules/events.js#L48-L65))\r\n",

On initial creation, the value returned by the getter is not made reactive since #7302 makes sure not to fetch it and `observe(val)` is a no-op.  However, if the value is set again after the property has been made reactive, it is made reactive as well since `observe(newVal)` in `set` is not gated on missing a getter.  (The premise justifying the change in #7280 that \"why should we get the value of the property in walk, despite the fact, that it is used only if the property has no getter\" is wrong, as the value was used in the call to `observe` even if the property had a getter.)\r\n\r\nWith the present change, properties that _only_ have a getter will still not have their value fetched and won't be made reactive, which should continue to satisfy @DeyLak's needs IIUC.  However, properties that have both a getter and a setter will continue to behave like they did before, being made recursively reactive, and their initial value treated consistently with subsequently set ones.\r\n\r\nIf you think that treating getter vs getter/setter properties differently is confusing, then you may want to revert #7302 instead so all values are made recursively reactive, irrespective of how the property is defined.  This may be easier for developers to understand but would break @DeyLak's use case.\r\n",

For example, `methods`, `data` will not appear in completion list.  This is caused by the intricate overloading resolution in compiler host. https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8005.\r\n\r\nThis problem will probably not fixed in foreseeable future. So we can work around this by placing normal component option before functional component. In most case, normal component option provides better completion. However, this will break type inference for functional component definition. \r\n\r\nBy providing an additional argument in normal component's `render`, we can at least compile functional component. Unfortunately, this work around will skip checking `RenderContenxt`. IMHO Vue's type checking isn't primarily for checking but for completion and definition looking up. So I think this is a advantageous trade-off. ",

There are a few options to do this:\r\n\r\n1. Bind a function directly into the component. But it forces users of the component to write a function or needs the creator of the component writes property type checks to determine whether the prop value is callable or not.\r\n2. Pass a callback parameter for the event. But nobody wants callbacks today.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, I'd like `$emit` or something else returns an array that collects all return values of its event callbacks. In order not to break old code, the behavior of `$emit` was kept ( which returns this ), but I wrote a new function instead. The function name `$notify` is not decided, but I can't come up with a better name.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5443\r\nRelated question: https://segmentfault.com/q/1010000011143372",

The problem is that we used to mark default vm type  as `Vue` in `Component`. However, since `ComponentOption` is contravariant against vm type `V`. The default bound should not be the upper bound `Vue`, but the lower bound `never`.\r\n\r\nFor a more concrete example, consider this usage:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface MyComponent extends Vue {\r\n   num: number;\r\n }\r\n \r\nconst option: ComponentOptions<MyComponent> = {\r\n  // a lifetime method\r\n  created(this: MyComponent) { return this.num.toFixed() }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, assigning option to `ComponentOption<Vue>`, we could in theory do unsafe operation:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst anotherOption: ComponentOptions<Vue> = option\r\n\r\nanotherOption.created.call(new Vue) // error! no property num on Vue!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough it is not how we really use Vue, type checker cannot know this. To workaround, we can mark  `anotherOption` to have vm type as `never`.  `never` is the bottom type of any type, so `ComponentOption<never>`'s `create` method can accept nothing, and thusly any `create` method from subclass can satisfy _accepting nothing_ semantic. In practical words, this means we promise that we **never** use `created` like the way above. ",

My solution to the problem was a separate overload for `Vue.extend` and `Vue.component` that involves a third typed props type.

It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [[more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner)]. See how it looks on [this repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).\r\nWe have also added a `postinstall` script to let people know after `npm|yarn install` that you are welcoming donations (optional). [[More info](https://github.com/OpenCollective/opencollective-cli)]\r\nYou can also add a \"Donate\" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets\r\n\r\n  P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing \"required\" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).\r\n\r\n  Thank you for your great contribution to the open source community. You are awesome! \ud83d\ude4c\r\n  And welcome to the open collective community! \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\n  Come chat with us in the #opensource channel on https://slack.opencollective.com - great place to ask questions and share best practices with other open source sustainers!\r\n  ",

        "body": "This pull request supersedes #5887 .\r\n\r\nKey improvements:\r\n1.  More backward compatible via generic default\r\n2. Props type inference\r\n\r\n@ktsn @kaorun343 @DanielRosenwasser Your reviews or suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThis section provides more background for other reviewers/readers.\r\n\r\nVue + TS users currently need helper library like vue-component-class to provide alternative API for TypeScript. Alternative API uses code pattern that TypeScript recognizes, but it splits Vue community.\r\n\r\nThankfully, TypeScript introduces [ThisType](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/14141) which can greatly improve Vue's canonical API. This PR introduces ThisType to Vue's official typing.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, this  improvement also benefits **JavaScript users**! VSCode users or Vue-language-server users exploits TypeScript compiler to provide editor services for JavaScript. Thus the typing improvement can help JavaScript completion more intelligent.\r\n\r\nGoal:\r\n1. Provide good enough completions for both JS users and new TS users (if they use canonical API).\r\n2. Don't break existing TS libraries or projects. Or, make breaking minimal.\r\n\r\nNon Goal:\r\n1. This PR won't provide 100% typing precision or use case coverage. Such typing would be too prohibitive for both maintainers and users to reason.\r\n2. Checking errors in JS isn't kept in mind. So changing existing JS to TS will cause errors.\r\n\r\nKnown limitations:\r\n1. `new Vue()` wouldn't return a type with props type. This is caused by compiler limitations.\r\n2. Props typing uses a hacky trick.\r\n3. returning properties on this might trigger cyclic error, manual annotation is needed.\r\n4. Prop type's union type declaration like `oneProp: [String, User]` might not work without manual annotation.\r\n\r\nNext step:\r\nSince we already has a canonical Vue API in TS, next we can ship tsx support in the official repo.",

        "body": "This PR improves the Vue `.d.ts` files so that users can get some improved inference when using the `noImplicitThis` compiler option. It takes advantage of many of the features the TypeScript team has been working on over the last few versions. Thus, it requires a minimum TypeScript version of 2.4. You can get this working with the current `typescript@next` (which is `2.5.0-dev.20170614`, but don't let that version number fool you - this will work with the final release of 2.4).\r\n\r\nThe best part about this change is that it makes using Vue easier when users choose not to use classes and inheritance. In other words, users and can more easily `new` up an instance using the Vue constructor, and can create components using the `Vue.extend` and `Vue.component` APIs a little more naturally. Extending Vue as a class will still work, so if you prefer to use vue-class-component and the rest, that should still work! However, those dependencies may need to be updated for this change.\r\n\r\nThere's definitely some amount of complexity that's been introduced but I'm willing to iterate on this with the help of others. Given the feedback that we've heard on [TypeScript-Vue-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Vue-Starter), it's been a positive experience for users.\r\n\r\nFixes many of the issues users have asked about in #478.\r\n\r\nTests are probably failing at this point because I need to update the project's dependency on TypeScript.",

        "body": "Currently handleError is used to handle errors during lifecycle hooks and component rendering. This handles most errors thrown by the component however event handlers are not handled. So a component like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n  <button @click=\"error()\">I Throw Errors</button>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  {\r\n    methods: {\r\n      error() { throw new Error('thrown!'); }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill simple throw an error and the error will never be passed to `handleError` nor is one able to use `Vue.config.errorHandler` for error reporting. For my specific use case I wanted to make sure that the plugin I use to report errors to Honeybadger would catch and report errors in event handlers, but more generally any error reporting that relies on `errorHandler` will require this.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to me that, for consistency, Vue would want to handle errors in event handlers the same way as is done lifecycle hooks and rendering. This is consistent with the changes requested and completed in #5198 and #4370.\r\n\r\nAs this is my first PR, I hope these changes are up to the code standard for the project, but if there is anything else needed just let me know and I'll fix it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE -->\r\n<!-- (Update \"[ ]\" to \"[x]\" to check a box) -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Build-related changes\r\n- [ ] Other, please describe:\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No\r\n\r\nIf yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:\r\n\r\nWhile it is unlikely any running apps would have depended on this behaviour.

Since errors are not re-thrown by `handleError` any code that was depending on errors in events not being handled could theoretically break.

It only adds a fews operations (both `toLowerCase` and `hasOwnProperty` are fast enough) in O(n) so I would say the impact on performance is negligible (almost no impact when running unit test on my machine). \r\n\r\nthanks!",

For quick reference you can find it [here.](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=7bd1d75ceeb95d343d9e16d305e782cd)\r\n\r\nSize of the library goes from 102KB to 49KB.\r\n\r\nThis resolves my original problem as the \"Glyphicons\" module of bootstrap is no longer included and the references to fonts have been removed from the library.\r\n\r\n#### Update based on comments:\r\nThis PR now removes the bootstrap library that the js-repaint-perfs library was using in favour of using the `styles.css` that the library now uses.",

        "body": "Currently, whenever you call `Vue.set` or `Vue.delete`, all observers on the object being modified are executed.  This is a \"safe\" practice, because it ensures that any objects who had previously attempted to access the key being added or deleted get their dependencies re-computed.\r\n\r\nHowever, consider the case where you have an object with many different keys and watchers, which might be expensive to call.  In this case, `Vue.set` will do a lot of work executing all of the watchers, even if none of them respond to the new field in the object, causing poor performance.\r\n\r\nHere is a fiddle to demonstrate the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/exe3nxzg/2/ .  Adding new keys to the object causes the watcher on the original field to be triggered, even though that watcher doesn't care about the values of the new keys.\r\n\r\nThis PR offers a possible fix to the problem, which is to add an options object as the final argument of `Vue.set` and `Vue.delete`.  If the user wishes to manually suppress notifications on the object and prevent all watchers from being computed, they can pass `{ notify: false }` as the final argument.\r\n\r\nAnother possible fix would be to add a new function called `Vue.get`.  If `Vue.set` replaces the syntax `obj[key]=value` and `Vue.delete` replaces the syntax `delete obj[key]`, then `Vue.get` would replace the syntax `obj[key] || default`.  More precisely, a definition could look something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nVue.get = function(obj, key, defaultValue) {\r\n\tif (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\r\n\t\t// create the key on the object with the default value.\r\n\t\t// call defineReactive(), etc.\r\n\t\t// however, do NOT call notify on the object.\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn obj[key];\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, whenever a key access is attempted, a reactive is left behind, such that setting the property in the future, even via `Vue.set`, will not cause a full notify.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

        "body": "DISCLAIMER: I don't have enough knowledge in nodejs nor V8. I read most cpp/internal js  is by guessing and cramming on cppreference.com :/  I welcome any correction!\r\n\r\nThis pr tries to alleviate the problem in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4872. When users include third party library into server bundle, the parsing overhead can be smaller.\r\n\r\nIf user provided global variable is compared with another global variable in library code, they will never be equal because they are executed in different context.\r\n\r\nTo fix this generally, we have to run library code and user code in the same context. This means we need to parse a lot of code in one request. \r\n\r\nWe can skip parsing by creating a `Script` object, and `runInNewContext` is [effectively a shortcut](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/5de3cf099cd01c84d1809dab90c041b76aa58d8e/lib/vm.js#L62-L65). Thus it is safe to reuse the `Script` object.\r\n\r\nReusing `Script` should save several C++ call and reduce garbage collection pressure since the underlying C++ object has a [`Persistent`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/5de3cf099cd01c84d1809dab90c041b76aa58d8e/src/node_contextify.cc#L461) which will not be collected until [out of memory](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/5080) (it is cargo cult to me, though).\r\n\r\nHowever, I **cannot see a performance improvement** in a simple benchmark,  regardless of whether bundling library code into server entry. (I use vue-hackernews as example, tested under `ab -n 1000 -c 100`).\r\nIt seems v8 will [cache compiled code](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/30224360c10ddd065f46eb81fffa69b88e5378d2/src/compiler.cc#L1571-L1573). So parsing overhead is relatively ignorable in real world.\r\n\r\nBut reusing object is still a good practice, so I submitted this pull request for symbolic value.",

So I changed its content in order to allow users to use what version they like with TypeScript.\r\nOf course, the past definitions were written for TS 1.x, but this one is for TS 2.x.\r\n\r\n* `DirectiveOption(s)` is going to be generic interface\r\n* `Directive` -> `DirectiveInstance<V extends Vue>`\r\n\r\nThanks.",

        "body": "(This is all open for debate and I understand that it is previously undiscussed pull request, but it is easier to debate it with concrete code changes available.)\r\n\r\nI am working on integration of Vue with [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) and I would like that Vue could be a drop-in replacement for Blaze. That is almost possible, because architecture is very similar. Vue is also using reactive dependency tracking, observer, while Meteor/Blaze is using [Tracker](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/tracker). Now, there is a lot of code written for Meteor which is using Tracker and it would be great if it could just work with Vue. And in fact it is doable. I managed to create a [full 100% compatible Tracker implementation on top of Vue's observer](https://github.com/mitar/vue-test/blob/master/packages/tracker/tracker.js). But there are some changes necessary to observer's implementation and some internals have to be exposed.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is initial version of changes I had to do to get this first version of Tracker implemented, to get discussion rolling. I would really like to see if this or something like this could get merged into Vue. From my perspective changes do not really change how observer is working, and all existing tests are still passing.\r\n\r\nA list of changes:\r\n\r\n* added support for after flush callbacks\r\n* adding a way to force flushing\r\n* fixed exception recovery for pushTarget/popTarget\r\n* correctly cleanup queue if there is an exception from getter\r\n* exposing some internals (probably too much, API could be cleaner there)\r\n\r\nRequesting comments, feedback, suggestions. This is work in progress. I will add tests in the future, after we finalize that this is OK to do and everything else.\r\n\r\n[Example app](https://github.com/mitar/vue-test). Notice how I can use [Meteor ReactiveVar inside computed value directly](https://github.com/mitar/vue-test/blob/master/client/app.vue#L34).",

To support this, I introduced a new flag on VNode `isAsyncPlaceholder`. A placeholder VNode is same as an emptyVNode, except the new flag set to true. Before this commit, an async component will be rendered to emptyVNode(in `createElement`). After this commit, an async component will be rendered to placeholderVNode. So the behavior in client-side rendering or bailed SSR rendering should be kept.\r\n\r\nIn SSR hydration, we skip checking a placeholder VNode against a real element. After component is resolved, the Vue instance in question will `$forceUpdate` in callback. So even if the real element dismatches with resolved VNode, rendered dom structure should be up to date. \r\n\r\n**Current implementation cannot reuse dom for async component because `isHydrating` is not available in `createComponent`.**\r\n\r\nAnother potential problem is that third party code can attach event handler / store data on SSR element. Those information will be lost in `$forceUpdate` callback. But I would suggest library users should care about it because I wonder if a library can provide a silver-bullet strategy.",

        "body": "Fixes #3940. This was a bit of a brainless error on my part - I apologize. Something I noticed however, is that none of our tests are currently covering the production build of Vue, thus allowing this error to slip through. To prevent this in the future, I was wondering if we should split the unit tests into two groups:\n- Development-specific behavior (e.g. warnings)\n- Features that should behave the same in both dev and prod, which will perform a second run with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`\n\nI think that work would be well outside the scope of this PR, but as a stop-gap measure to cover production at least a little, I switched all of the e2e examples to use the production build, then tweaked the grid example so that I could add a regression test. \n\nMy thinking is that production is probably most important for e2e anyway, as devs will more quickly discover development-only errors (and they won't affect end users). The only downside I can foresee is that if someone clones the repo to start playing with examples, they won't get any nice warnings if they make a mistake. So, I added a comment above each Vue script with instructions to use the development version if they'd like. Still, I'm happy to change it back if this is undesirable. We'd just have to think of another way to add a regression test.\n\nOne last unrelated note: while updating the examples, I noticed that the todomvc's HTML file was full of tabs rather than spaces, so I converted them for consistency.\n",

It allows the consumer of a component to choose how to render a component, while having access to data passed down by the parent.\n\nIt is similar to slots, in a way, except slots only gain you access to the data in the hosting component.\n\nFor more information on the possibilities that this pattern enables, please see [this blog post](https://medium.com/merrickchristensen/function-as-child-components-5f3920a9ace9), [this presentation from Ryan Florence at React Rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp-NOggyz54), as well as the new API for [React Router 4.0](https://react-router.now.sh/).\n\nBefore I go on, I do want to say that the pattern is achievable right now using props:\n\nIt is possible now to mimic this using props with the following pattern:\n\n```\nconst ComponentWithInfo = {\n    props: ['render'],\n    render (h) {\n       return this.render('Hello, World');\n    }\n}\n\nnew Vue({\n    render (h) {\n         return <ComponentWithData render={data => <span>{data}</span>}></ComponentWithData>\n    }\n})\n```\n\nHowever, \"first-class\" support would be nice.\n\nAs far as the vue flavor, the API looks like this:\n\n```\nconst ComponentWithInfo = {\n    render (h) {\n       return this.$slots.default('Hello, World')\n    }\n}\n\nnew Vue({\n    render (h) {\n         return <ComponentWithData>{data => <span>{data}</span>}</ComponentWithData>\n    }\n})\n```\n\nA couple of things:\n\n1) In my implementation, if an array is passed for children, and any of the children are a function, that will throw away all children, except for the function\n2) I understand that there is an API freeze, but this is not breaking any existing APIs, only adding on.\n3) Please feel free to reject this specific PR, although if you do, I think this is worthwhile feature to consider.\n",

If allowed, I'd like to refer to the official documents.\n- [x] Adding a test if needed as well as we did in DefinitelyTyped\n- Modifying `vue-class-component` to use this new definition file when this is finished\n\nThanks.\n",

This causes `Dep.target` to never be reset to `null`.\n\nThis is most likely not the best solution. Maybe a better place for solution would be around [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/instance/lifecycle.js#L54) or [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/observer/watcher.js#L77).\n\nAlso I can't come up with a better unit test than the original repro:\n- Create two instances, first with a computed property (easiest way to reproduce), make sure computed field is used in the template,\n- Change the data of the second instance,\n- Make sure that first instance didn't update.\n\nShould I include it anyway?\n\n/cc @yyx990803 \n",

And let it be able to append the whole dom tree either once or node-by-node:\n1. changed `__h__(tag, data, children)` into `__r__(__s__(tag, data), children)` so the parent node could be calculate->generate->append first and the children later.\n2. supported `stream: true` option and added a new `__stream_patch__` method besides `__patch__` to optimize the first-time rendering logic. If no `stream: true` option set, just render as normal before.\n3. supported `atom: true` in `vnode.data` to describe whether this node will be appended with its children together as a atom or child-by-child in \"stream rendering\" mode.\n\nAdditionally, I changed the `class`/`staticClass` from string to array and added an object `staticStyle` for better virtual dom control.\n",

This can cause troubles with several currencies out there whose number of decimal places can be 0 (e.g. Japanese Yen or Vietnamese Dong) or 3 (e.g. Jordanian Dinar).\n\nThis commit modifies the filter to accept an extra optional argument: decimal places, which defaults to 2. With this, one can write `{{ 1234 | currency '\u00a5' 0 }}` to properly display a Yen value. Backward compatibility is maintained.\n\n(Just realized there's a [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35725935/need-a-flexible-currency-filter-in-vuejs) about this very issue, where the OP was recommended to create a new filter, which is anti-DRY IMO).\n",

But if the only type is `Function`, it won't be called, like before. In practice it probably doesn't makes sense to have a property that can be either a Function or something else.\n- If the default is not specified and the property is omitted, the default is undefined, except for Boolean, where it is false. For a mixed type, the default will be undefined even if one of the possible types is Boolean. It might make sense to use false as the default here, but in practice both are falsy, and you can specify a default, so it's not a big issue.\n- In contrast to the previous point, if one of the possible types is Boolean (explicitly specified), and the attribute value is omitted (or is an empty string), it will be cast to true, even if String is also an accepted type for the property. This is how it worked previously for Boolean type properties, so I extended that to mixed properties that include Boolean. It made more sense for a property without a value to be true in this case, instead of a falsy empty string.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nprop1: [Boolean, String]\nprop2: String\n\n<example></example> <!-- undefined undefined -->\n<example prop1 prop2></example> <!-- true, '' -->\n<example prop1=\"foo\" prop2=\"foo\"></example> <!-- 'foo' 'foo' -->\n<example prop1=\"123\" prop2=\"123\"></example> <!-- '123' '123' -->\n```\n",

Besides testing and other coverage, documenting your code is often neglected although it is a very engaging part of Open Source.\n\nSo far over 500 **Ruby** projects are sporting these badges to raise awareness for the importance of inline-docs and to show potential contributors that they can expect a certain level of code documentation when they dive into your project's code and motivate them to eventually document their own.\n\nI would really like to do the same for the **JavaScript** community and roll out support for JS over the coming weeks (early adopters are [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever), [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [Shipit](https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit)).\n\nAlthough this is \"only\" a passion project, I really would like to hear your thoughts, critique and suggestions. Your status page is http://inch-ci.org/github/yyx990803/vue\n\nWhat do you think?\n",

        "body": "This directive is an attempt to decouple as much of the DOM as possible from our ViewModel. With this directive you can set a control for the ViewModel scope with a specified key. Therefore instead of doing (using jQuery for quick example):\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"demo\" v-on=\"click:fadeIn\">\n    <div class=\"sub-control\">{{ message }}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n``` js\nvar demo = new Vue({\n    el: '#demo',\n    data: {\n        message: 'Hello Vue.js!'\n    },\n    method: {\n        fadeIn: {\n            var el = $(this.$el),\n                // what if our class name changes??\n                subControl = $('.sub-control', el);\n\n            subControl.fadeIn();\n        }\n    }\n})\n```\n\nYou can do this instead:\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"demo\" v-on=\"click:fadeIn\">\n    <div v-control=\"sub-control\">{{ message }}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n``` javascript\nvar demo = new Vue({\n    el: '#demo',\n    data: {\n        message: 'Hello Vue.js!'\n    },\n    method: {\n        fadeIn: {\n            // does not care what class is, references controls key instead\n            $(this.$controls['sub-control']).fadeIn();\n        }\n    }\n})\n```\n\nCurrently the directive will accept all letters, numbers, and `-_` characters as key values for the $controls object.\n",

I will also make a pull request on https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org.\n",
